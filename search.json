    "text": "Microcontrollers (MCUs) are cheap electronic components, usually with just a few kilobytes of RAM, and designed to consume small amounts of power. Today, MCUs can be found embedded in all residential, medical, automotive, and industrial devices. Over 40 billion microcontrollers are estimated to be marketed annually, and hundreds of billions are currently in service. But, curiously, these devices receive little attention because, many times, they are used just to replace functionalities that older electromechanical systems face in cars, washing machines, or remote controls.\nMore recently, with the era of IoT (Internet of Things), a significant part of these MCUs is generating “quintillions” of data, which, in their majority, are not used due to the high cost and complexity of their data transmission (bandwidth and latency).\nOn the other hand, in the last decades, we have witnessed the development of Machine Learning models (sub-area of Artificial Intelligence) trained with “tons” of data and powerful mainframes. But now, it suddenly becomes possible for “noisy” and complex signals, such as images, audio, or accelerometers, to extract meaning from the same through neural networks. More importantly, we can execute these models of neural networks in microcontrollers and sensors using very little energy and extract much more meaning from the data generated by these sensors, which we are currently ignoring.\n\nTinyML, a new area of Applied AI, allows extracting “machine intelligence” from the physical world (where the data is generated).\n\nTinyML Made Ease is a foundational text designed to facilitate the understanding and application of Embedded Machine Learning, or TinyML. In an era where embedded devices boast ultra-low power consumption—measured in mere milliwatts—and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TF Lite Micro) become increasingly tailored for embedded applications, the intersection of AI and IoT is rapidly expanding. This book demystifies the integration of AI capabilities into these devices, paving the way for a wide-reaching adoption of AI-enabled IoT, or “AioT.”"

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe Arduino Nicla Vision (sometimes called NiclaV) is a development board that includes two processors that can run tasks in parallel. It is part of a family of development boards with the same form factor but designed for specific tasks, such as the Nicla Sense ME and the Nicla Voice. The Niclas can efficiently run processes created with TensorFlow™ Lite. For example, one of the cores of the NiclaV runs a computer vision algorithm on the fly (inference), while the other executes low-level operations like controlling a motor and communicating or acting as a user interface. The onboard wireless module allows the management of WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity simultaneously."

The two cores communicate via a Remote Procedure Call mechanism that seamlessly allows calling functions on the other processor. Both processors share all the on-chip peripherals and can run:\n\nArduino sketches on top of the Arm® Mbed™ OS\nNative Mbed™ applications\nMicroPython / JavaScript via an interpreter\nTensorFlow™ Lite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Memory\nMemory is crucial for embedded machine learning projects. The NiclaV board can host up to 16 MB of QSPI Flash for storage. However, it is essential to consider that the MCU SRAM is the one to be used with machine learning inferences; the STM32H747 is only 1MB, shared by both processors. This MCU also has incorporated 2MB of FLASH, mainly for code storage.\n\n\n1.2.3 Sensors\n\nCamera: A GC2145 2 MP Color CMOS Camera.\nMicrophone: The MP34DT05 is an ultra-compact, low-power, omnidirectional, digital MEMS microphone built with a capacitive sensing element and the IC interface.\n6-Axis IMU: 3D gyroscope and 3D accelerometer data from the LSM6DSOX 6-axis IMU.\nTime of Flight Sensor: The VL53L1CBV0FY Time-of-Flight sensor adds accurate and low power-ranging capabilities to the Nicla Vision. The invisible near-infrared VCSEL laser (including the analog driver) is encapsulated with receiving optics in an all-in-one small module below the camera."

All connectors are 5V compatible.\n\nNote that all 17 Nicla Vision pins will be connected to the Shield Groves, but some Grove connections remain disconnected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shield is MKR compatible and can be used with the Nicla Vision and Portenta.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose that on a TinyML project, you want to send inference results using a LoRaWAN device and add information about local luminosity. Often, with offline operations, a local low-power display such as an OLED is advised. This setup can be seen here:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grove Light Sensor would be connected to one of the single Analog pins (A0/PC4), the LoRaWAN device to the UART, and the OLED to the I2C connector.\nThe Nicla Pins 3 (Tx) and 4 (Rx) are connected with the Serial Shield connector.

    "text": "2.7 The Impulse Design\nIn this phase, we should define how to:\n\nPre-process our data, which consists of resizing the individual images and determining the color depth to use (be it RGB or Grayscale) and\nSpecify a Model, in this case, it will be the Transfer Learning (Images) to fine-tune a pre-trained MobileNet V2 image classification model on our data. This method performs well even with relatively small image datasets (around 150 images in our case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Learning with MobileNet offers a streamlined approach to model training, which is especially beneficial for resource-constrained environments and projects with limited labeled data. MobileNet, known for its lightweight architecture, is a pre-trained model that has already learned valuable features from a large dataset (ImageNet).\n\n\n\n\n\nBy leveraging these learned features, you can train a new model for your specific task with fewer data and computational resources and yet achieve competitive accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach significantly reduces training time and computational cost, making it ideal for quick prototyping and deployment on embedded devices where efficiency is paramount.\nGo to the Impulse Design Tab and create the impulse, defining an image size of 96x96 and squashing them (squared form, without cropping). Select Image and Transfer Learning blocks. Save the Impulse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.1 Image Pre-Processing\nAll the input QVGA/RGB565 images will be converted to 27,640 features (96x96x3).\n\n\n\n\n\nPress [Save parameters] and Generate all features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Model Design\nIn 2007, Google introduced MobileNetV1, a family of general-purpose computer vision neural networks designed with mobile devices in mind to support classification, detection, and more. MobileNets are small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of various use cases. in 2018, Google launched MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks.\nMobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2 aim at mobile efficiency and embedded vision applications but differ in architectural complexity and performance. While both use depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the computational cost, MobileNet V2 introduces Inverted Residual Blocks and Linear Bottlenecks to enhance performance. These new features allow V2 to capture more complex features using fewer parameters, making it computationally more efficient and generally more accurate than its predecessor. Additionally, V2 employs a non-linear activation in the intermediate expansion layer. It still uses a linear activation for the bottleneck layer, a design choice found to preserve important information through the network. MobileNet V2 offers an optimized architecture for higher accuracy and efficiency and will be used in this project.\nAlthough the base MobileNet architecture is already tiny and has low latency, many times, a specific use case or application may require the model to be even smaller and faster. MobileNets introduces a straightforward parameter α (alpha) called width multiplier to construct these smaller, less computationally expensive models. The role of the width multiplier α is that of thinning a network uniformly at each layer.\nEdge Impulse Studio can use both MobileNetV1 (96x96 images) and V2 (96x96 or 160x160 images), with several different α values (from 0.05 to 1.0). For example, you will get the highest accuracy with V2, 160x160 images, and α=1.0. Of course, there is a trade-off. The higher the accuracy, the more memory (around 1.3MB RAM and 2.6MB ROM) will be needed to run the model, implying more latency. The smaller footprint will be obtained at the other extreme with MobileNetV1 and α=0.10 (around 53.2K RAM and 101K ROM).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use MobileNetV2 96x96 0.1 for this project, with an estimated memory cost of 265.3 KB in RAM. This model should be OK for the Nicla Vision with 1MB of SRAM. On the Transfer Learning Tab, select this model:"

    "text": "2.8 Model Training\nAnother valuable technique to be used with Deep Learning is Data Augmentation. Data augmentation is a method to improve the accuracy of machine learning models by creating additional artificial data. A data augmentation system makes small, random changes to your training data during the training process (such as flipping, cropping, or rotating the images).\nLooking under the hood, here you can see how Edge Impulse implements a data Augmentation policy on your data:\n# Implements the data augmentation policy\ndef augment_image(image, label):\n    # Flips the image randomly\n    image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image)\n\n    # Increase the image size, then randomly crop it down to\n    # the original dimensions\n    resize_factor = random.uniform(1, 1.2)\n    new_height = math.floor(resize_factor * INPUT_SHAPE[0])\n    new_width = math.floor(resize_factor * INPUT_SHAPE[1])\n    image = tf.image.resize_with_crop_or_pad(image, new_height, new_width)\n    image = tf.image.random_crop(image, size=INPUT_SHAPE)\n\n    # Vary the brightness of the image\n    image = tf.image.random_brightness(image, max_delta=0.2)\n\n    return image, label\nExposure to these variations during training can help prevent your model from taking shortcuts by “memorizing” superficial clues in your training data, meaning it may better reflect the deep underlying patterns in your dataset.\nThe final layer of our model will have 12 neurons with a 15% dropout for overfitting prevention. Here is the Training result:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is excellent, with 77ms of latency, which should result in 13fps (frames per second) during inference."

    "text": "2.10 Deploying the model\nAt this point, we can deploy the trained model as.tflite and use the OpenMV IDE to run it using MicroPython, or we can deploy it as a C/C++ or an Arduino library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10.1 Arduino Library\nFirst, Let’s deploy it as an Arduino Library:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should install the library as.zip on the Arduino IDE and run the sketch nicla_vision_camera.ino available in Examples under your library name.\n\nNote that Arduino Nicla Vision has, by default, 512KB of RAM allocated for the M7 core and an additional 244KB on the M4 address space. In the code, this allocation was changed to 288 kB to guarantee that the model will run on the device (malloc_addblock((void*)0x30000000, 288 * 1024);).\n\nThe result is good, with 86ms of measured latency.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short video showing the inference results: \n\n\n2.10.2 OpenMV\nIt is possible to deploy the trained model to be used with OpenMV in two ways: as a library and as a firmware.\nThree files are generated as a library: the trained.tflite model, a list with labels, and a simple MicroPython script that can make inferences using the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning this model as a .tflite directly in the Nicla was impossible. So, we can sacrifice the accuracy using a smaller model or deploy the model as an OpenMV Firmware (FW). Choosing FW, the Edge Impulse Studio generates optimized models, libraries, and frameworks needed to make the inference. Let’s explore this option.\nSelect OpenMV Firmware on the Deploy Tab and press [Build].\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your computer, you will find a ZIP file. Open it:\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Bootloader tool on the OpenMV IDE to load the FW on your board:\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate file (.bin for Nicla-Vision):\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the download is finished, press OK:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a message says that the FW is outdated, DO NOT UPGRADE. Select [NO].\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, open the script ei_image_classification.py that was downloaded from the Studio and the.bin file for the Nicla.\n\n\n\n\n\nRun it. Pointing the camera to the objects we want to classify, the inference result will be displayed on the Serial Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10.2.1 Changing the Code to add labels\nThe code provided by Edge Impulse can be modified so that we can see, for test reasons, the inference result directly on the image displayed on the OpenMV IDE.\nUpload the code from GitHub, or modify it as below:\n# Marcelo Rovai - NICLA Vision - Image Classification\n# Adapted from Edge Impulse - OpenMV Image Classification Example\n# @24Aug23\n\nimport sensor, image, time, os, tf, uos, gc\n\nsensor.reset()                         # Reset and initialize the sensor.\nsensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)    # Set pxl fmt to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)\nsensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)      # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)\nsensor.set_windowing((240, 240))       # Set 240x240 window.\nsensor.skip_frames(time=2000)          # Let the camera adjust.\n\nnet = None\nlabels = None\n\ntry:\n    # Load built in model\n    labels, net = tf.load_builtin_model('trained')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise Exception(e)\n\nclock = time.clock()\nwhile(True):\n    clock.tick()  # Starts tracking elapsed time.\n\n    img = sensor.snapshot()\n\n    # default settings just do one detection\n    for obj in net.classify(img, \n                            min_scale=1.0, \n                            scale_mul=0.8, \n                            x_overlap=0.5, \n                            y_overlap=0.5):\n        fps = clock.fps()\n        lat = clock.avg()\n\n        print(\"**********\\nPrediction:\")\n        img.draw_rectangle(obj.rect())\n        # This combines the labels and confidence values into a list of tuples\n        predictions_list = list(zip(labels, obj.output()))\n\n        max_val = predictions_list[0][1]\n        max_lbl = 'background'\n        for i in range(len(predictions_list)):\n            val = predictions_list[i][1]\n            lbl = predictions_list[i][0]\n\n            if val &gt; max_val:\n                max_val = val\n                max_lbl = lbl\n\n    # Print label with the highest probability\n    if max_val &lt; 0.5:\n        max_lbl = 'uncertain'\n    print(\"{} with a prob of {:.2f}\".format(max_lbl, max_val))\n    print(\"FPS: {:.2f} fps ==&gt; latency: {:.0f} ms\".format(fps, lat))\n\n    # Draw label with highest probability to image viewer\n    img.draw_string(\n        10, 10,\n        max_lbl + \"\\n{:.2f}\".format(max_val),\n        mono_space = False,\n        scale=2\n        )\nHere you can see the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the latency (136 ms) is almost double of what we got directly with the Arduino IDE. This is because we are using the IDE as an interface and also the time to wait for the camera to be ready. If we start the clock just before the inference:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latency will drop to only 71 ms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NiclaV runs about half as fast when connected to the IDE. The FPS should increase once disconnected.\n\n\n\n2.10.2.2 Post-Processing with LEDs\nWhen working with embedded machine learning, we are looking for devices that can continually proceed with the inference and result, taking some action directly on the physical world and not displaying the result on a connected computer. To simulate this, we will light up a different LED for each possible inference result.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo accomplish that, we should upload the code from GitHub or change the last code to include the LEDs:\n# Marcelo Rovai - NICLA Vision - Image Classification with LEDs\n# Adapted from Edge Impulse - OpenMV Image Classification Example\n# @24Aug23\n\nimport sensor, image, time, os, tf, uos, gc, pyb\n\nledRed = pyb.LED(1)\nledGre = pyb.LED(2)\nledBlu = pyb.LED(3)\n\nsensor.reset()                         # Reset and initialize the sensor.\nsensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)    # Set pixl fmt to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)\nsensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)      # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)\nsensor.set_windowing((240, 240))       # Set 240x240 window.\nsensor.skip_frames(time=2000)          # Let the camera adjust.\n\nnet = None\nlabels = None\n\nledRed.off()\nledGre.off()\nledBlu.off()\n\ntry:\n    # Load built in model\n    labels, net = tf.load_builtin_model('trained')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise Exception(e)\n\nclock = time.clock()\n\n\ndef setLEDs(max_lbl):\n\n    if max_lbl == 'uncertain':\n        ledRed.on()\n        ledGre.off()\n        ledBlu.off()\n\n    if max_lbl == 'periquito':\n        ledRed.off()\n        ledGre.on()\n        ledBlu.off()\n\n    if max_lbl == 'robot':\n        ledRed.off()\n        ledGre.off()\n        ledBlu.on()\n\n    if max_lbl == 'background':\n        ledRed.off()\n        ledGre.off()\n        ledBlu.off()\n\n\nwhile(True):\n    img = sensor.snapshot()\n    clock.tick()  # Starts tracking elapsed time.\n\n    # default settings just do one detection.\n    for obj in net.classify(img, \n                            min_scale=1.0, \n                            scale_mul=0.8, \n                            x_overlap=0.5, \n                            y_overlap=0.5):\n        fps = clock.fps()\n        lat = clock.avg()\n\n        print(\"**********\\nPrediction:\")\n        img.draw_rectangle(obj.rect())\n        # This combines the labels and confidence values into a list of tuples\n        predictions_list = list(zip(labels, obj.output()))\n\n        max_val = predictions_list[0][1]\n        max_lbl = 'background'\n        for i in range(len(predictions_list)):\n            val = predictions_list[i][1]\n            lbl = predictions_list[i][0]\n\n            if val &gt; max_val:\n                max_val = val\n                max_lbl = lbl\n\n    # Print label and turn on LED with the highest probability\n    if max_val &lt; 0.8:\n        max_lbl = 'uncertain'\n\n    setLEDs(max_lbl)\n\n    print(\"{} with a prob of {:.2f}\".format(max_lbl, max_val))\n    print(\"FPS: {:.2f} fps ==&gt; latency: {:.0f} ms\".format(fps, lat))\n\n    # Draw label with highest probability to image viewer\n    img.draw_string(\n        10, 10,\n        max_lbl + \"\\n{:.2f}\".format(max_val),\n        mono_space = False,\n        scale=2\n        )\nNow, each time that a class scores a result greater than 0.8, the correspondent LED will be lit:\n\nLed Red 0n: Uncertain (no class is over 0.8)\nLed Green 0n: Periquito &gt; 0.8\nLed Blue 0n: Robot &gt; 0.8\nAll LEDs Off: Background &gt; 0.8\n\nHere is the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more detail"

The model still only recognizes the predominant category on the image, the tabby cat:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what happens if there is not a dominant category on the image?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model identifies the above image completely wrong as an “ashcan,” possibly due to the color tonalities.\n\nThe model used in all previous examples is the MobileNet, trained with a large dataset, the ImageNet.\n\nTo solve this issue, we need another type of model, where not only multiple categories (or labels) can be found but also where the objects are located on a given image.\nAs we can imagine, such models are much more complicated and bigger, for example, the MobileNetV2 SSD FPN-Lite 320x320, trained with the COCO dataset. This pre-trained object detection model is designed to locate up to 10 objects within an image, outputting a bounding box for each object detected. The below image is the result of such a model running on a Raspberry Pi:\n\n\n\n\n\nThose models used for Object detection (such as the MobileNet SSD or YOLO) usually have several MB in size, which is OK for use with Raspberry Pi but unsuitable for use with embedded devices, where the RAM usually is lower than 1M Bytes.\n\n\n3.1.2 An innovative solution for Object Detection: FOMO\nEdge Impulse launched in 2022, FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects), a novel solution to perform object detection on embedded devices, not only on the Nicla Vision (Cortex M7) but also on Cortex M4F CPUs (Arduino Nano33 and OpenMV M4 series) as well the Espressif ESP32 devices (ESP-CAM and XIAO ESP32S3 Sense).\nIn this Hands-On exercise, we will explore using FOMO with Object Detection, not entering many details about the model itself. To understand more about how the model works, you can go into the official FOMO announcement by Edge Impulse, where Louis Moreau and Mat Kelcey explain in detail how it works."

    "text": "3.6 Model Design, Training, and Test\nWe will use FOMO, an object detection model based on MobileNetV2 (alpha 0.35) designed to coarsely segment an image into a grid of background vs objects of interest (here, boxes and wheels).\nFOMO is an innovative machine learning model for object detection, which can use up to 30 times less energy and memory than traditional models like Mobilenet SSD and YOLOv5. FOMO can operate on microcontrollers with less than 200 KB of RAM. The main reason this is possible is that while other models calculate the object’s size by drawing a square around it (bounding box), FOMO ignores the size of the image, providing only the information about where the object is located in the image, by means of its centroid coordinates.\nHow FOMO works?\nFOMO takes the image in grayscale and divides it into blocks of pixels using a factor of 8. For the input of 96x96, the grid would be 12x12 (96/8=12). Next, FOMO will run a classifier through each pixel block to calculate the probability that there is a box or a wheel in each of them and, subsequently, determine the regions which have the highest probability of containing the object (If a pixel block has no objects, it will be classified as background). From the overlap of the final region, the FOMO provides the coordinates (related to the image dimensions) of the centroid of this region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor training, we should select a pre-trained model. Let’s use the FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) MobileNetV2 0.35`. This model uses around 250KB RAM and 80KB of ROM (Flash), which suits well with our board since it has 1MB of RAM and ROM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the training hyper-parameters, the model will be trained with:\n\nEpochs: 60,\nBatch size: 32\nLearning Rate: 0.001.\n\nFor validation during training, 20% of the dataset (validation_dataset) will be spared. For the remaining 80% (train_dataset), we will apply Data Augmentation, which will randomly flip, change the size and brightness of the image, and crop them, artificially increasing the number of samples on the dataset for training.\nAs a result, the model ends with practically 1.00 in the F1 score, with a similar result when using the Test data.\n\nNote that FOMO automatically added a 3rd label background to the two previously defined (box and wheel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn object detection tasks, accuracy is generally not the primary evaluation metric. Object detection involves classifying objects and providing bounding boxes around them, making it a more complex problem than simple classification. The issue is that we do not have the bounding box, only the centroids. In short, using accuracy as a metric could be misleading and may not provide a complete understanding of how well the model is performing. Because of that, we will use the F1 score.\n\n\n3.6.1 Test model with “Live Classification”\nSince Edge Impulse officially supports the Nicla Vision, let’s connect it to the Studio. For that, follow the steps:\n\nDownload the last EI Firmware and unzip it.\nOpen the zip file on your computer and select the uploader related to your OS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the Nicla-Vision on Boot Mode, pressing the reset button twice.\nExecute the specific batch code for your OS for uploading the binary (arduino-nicla-vision.bin) to your board.\n\nGo to Live classification section at EI Studio, and using webUSB, connect your Nicla Vision:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce connected, you can use the Nicla to capture actual images to be tested by the trained model on Edge Impulse Studio.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to be noted is that the model can produce false positives and negatives. This can be minimized by defining a proper Confidence Threshold (use the Three dots menu for the set-up). Try with 0.8 or more."

    "section": "4.3 Introduction to Audio Signals",
    "text": "4.3 Introduction to Audio Signals\nUnderstanding the basic properties of audio signals is crucial for effective feature extraction and, ultimately, for successfully applying machine learning algorithms in audio classification tasks. Audio signals are complex waveforms that capture fluctuations in air pressure over time. These signals can be characterized by several fundamental attributes: sampling rate, frequency, and amplitude.\n\nFrequency and Amplitude: Frequency refers to the number of oscillations a waveform undergoes per unit time and is also measured in Hz. In the context of audio signals, different frequencies correspond to different pitches. Amplitude, on the other hand, measures the magnitude of the oscillations and correlates with the loudness of the sound. Both frequency and amplitude are essential features that capture audio signals’ tonal and rhythmic qualities.\nSampling Rate: The sampling rate, often denoted in Hertz (Hz), defines the number of samples taken per second when digitizing an analog signal. A higher sampling rate allows for a more accurate digital representation of the signal but also demands more computational resources for processing. Typical sampling rates include 44.1 kHz for CD-quality audio and 16 kHz or 8 kHz for speech recognition tasks. Understanding the trade-offs in selecting an appropriate sampling rate is essential for balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. In general, with TinyML projects, we work with 16KHz. Altough music tones can be heard at frequencies up to 20 kHz, voice maxes out at 8 kHz. Traditional telephone systems use an 8 kHz sampling frequency.\n\n\nFor an accurate representation of the signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.\n\n\nTime Domain vs. Frequency Domain: Audio signals can be analyzed in the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, a signal is represented as a waveform where the amplitude is plotted against time. This representation helps to observe temporal features like onset and duration but the signal’s tonal characteristics are not well evidenced. Conversely, a frequency domain representation provides a view of the signal’s constituent frequencies and their respective amplitudes, typically obtained via a Fourier Transform. This is invaluable for tasks that require understanding the signal’s spectral content, such as identifying musical notes or speech phonemes (our case).\n\nThe image below shows the words YES and NO with typical representations in the Time (Raw Audio) and Frequency domains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Why Not Raw Audio?\nWhile using raw audio data directly for machine learning tasks may seem tempting, this approach presents several challenges that make it less suitable for building robust and efficient models.\nUsing raw audio data for Keyword Spotting (KWS), for example, on TinyML devices poses challenges due to its high dimensionality (using a 16 kHz sampling rate), computational complexity for capturing temporal features, susceptibility to noise, and lack of semantically meaningful features, making feature extraction techniques like MFCCs a more practical choice for resource-constrained applications.\nHere are some additional details of the critical issues associated with using raw audio:\n\nHigh Dimensionality: Audio signals, especially those sampled at high rates, result in large amounts of data. For example, a 1-second audio clip sampled at 16 kHz will have 16,000 individual data points. High-dimensional data increases computational complexity, leading to longer training times and higher computational costs, making it impractical for resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, the wide dynamic range of audio signals requires a significant amount of bits per sample, while conveying little useful information.\nTemporal Dependencies: Raw audio signals have temporal structures that simple machine learning models may find hard to capture. While recurrent neural networks like LSTMs can model such dependencies, they are computationally intensive and tricky to train on tiny devices.\nNoise and Variability: Raw audio signals often contain background noise and other non-essential elements affecting model performance. Additionally, the same sound can have different characteristics based on various factors such as distance from the microphone, the orientation of the sound source, and acoustic properties of the environment, adding to the complexity of the data.\nLack of Semantic Meaning: Raw audio doesn’t inherently contain semantically meaningful features for classification tasks. Features like pitch, tempo, and spectral characteristics, which can be crucial for speech recognition, are not directly accessible from raw waveform data.\nSignal Redundancy: Audio signals often contain redundant information, with certain portions of the signal contributing little to no value to the task at hand. This redundancy can make learning inefficient and potentially lead to overfitting.\n\nFor these reasons, feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Mel-Frequency Energies (MFEs), and simple Spectograms are commonly used to transform raw audio data into a more manageable and informative format. These features capture the essential characteristics of the audio signal while reducing dimensionality and noise, facilitating more effective machine learning."

    "section": "4.4 Introduction to MFCCs",
    "text": "4.4 Introduction to MFCCs\n\n4.4.1 What are MFCCs?\nMel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a set of features derived from the spectral content of an audio signal. They are based on human auditory perceptions and are commonly used to capture the phonetic characteristics of an audio signal. The MFCCs are computed through a multi-step process that includes pre-emphasis, framing, windowing, applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the signal to the frequency domain, and finally, applying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The result is a compact representation of the original audio signal’s spectral characteristics.\nThe image below shows the words YES and NO in their MFCC representation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video explains the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and how to compute them.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Why are MFCCs important?\nMFCCs are crucial for several reasons, particularly in the context of Keyword Spotting (KWS) and TinyML:\n\nDimensionality Reduction: MFCCs capture essential spectral characteristics of the audio signal while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the data, making it ideal for resource-constrained TinyML applications.\nRobustness: MFCCs are less susceptible to noise and variations in pitch and amplitude, providing a more stable and robust feature set for audio classification tasks.\nHuman Auditory System Modeling: The Mel scale in MFCCs approximates the human ear’s response to different frequencies, making them practical for speech recognition where human-like perception is desired.\nComputational Efficiency: The process of calculating MFCCs is computationally efficient, making it well-suited for real-time applications on hardware with limited computational resources.\n\nIn summary, MFCCs offer a balance of information richness and computational efficiency, making them popular for audio classification tasks, particularly in constrained environments like TinyML.\n\n\n4.4.3 Computing MFCCs\nThe computation of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) involves several key steps. Let’s walk through these, which are particularly important for Keyword Spotting (KWS) tasks on TinyML devices.\n\nPre-emphasis: The first step is pre-emphasis, which is applied to accentuate the high-frequency components of the audio signal and balance the frequency spectrum. This is achieved by applying a filter that amplifies the difference between consecutive samples. The formula for pre-emphasis is: y(t) = x(t) - \\(\\alpha\\) x(t-1) , where \\(\\alpha\\) is the pre-emphasis factor, typically around 0.97.\nFraming: Audio signals are divided into short frames (the frame length), usually 20 to 40 milliseconds. This is based on the assumption that frequencies in a signal are stationary over a short period. Framing helps in analyzing the signal in such small time slots. The frame stride (or step) will displace one frame and the adjacent. Those steps could be sequential or overlapped.\nWindowing: Each frame is then windowed to minimize the discontinuities at the frame boundaries. A commonly used window function is the Hamming window. Windowing prepares the signal for a Fourier transform by minimizing the edge effects. The image below shows three frames (10, 20, and 30) and the time samples after windowing (note that the frame length and frame stride are 20 ms):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to each windowed frame to convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain. The FFT gives us a complex-valued representation that includes both magnitude and phase information. However, for MFCCs, only the magnitude is used to calculate the Power Spectrum. The power spectrum is the square of the magnitude spectrum and measures the energy present at each frequency component.\n\n\nThe power spectrum \\(P(f)\\) of a signal \\(x(t)\\) is defined as \\(P(f) = |X(f)|^2\\), where \\(X(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(x(t)\\). By squaring the magnitude of the Fourier Transform, we emphasize stronger frequencies over weaker ones, thereby capturing more relevant spectral characteristics of the audio signal. This is important in applications like audio classification, speech recognition, and Keyword Spotting (KWS), where the focus is on identifying distinct frequency patterns that characterize different classes of audio or phonemes in speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMel Filter Banks: The frequency domain is then mapped to the Mel scale, which approximates the human ear’s response to different frequencies. The idea is to extract more features (more filter banks) in the lower frequencies and less in the high frequencies. Thus, it performs well on sounds distinguished by the human ear. Typically, 20 to 40 triangular filters extract the Mel-frequency energies. These energies are then log-transformed to convert multiplicative factors into additive ones, making them more suitable for further processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT): The last step is to apply the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the log Mel energies. The DCT helps to decorrelate the energies, effectively compressing the data and retaining only the most discriminative features. Usually, the first 12-13 DCT coefficients are retained, forming the final MFCC feature vector."

This is often desirable for speech-related tasks. On the other hand, spectrograms or MFEs preserve more detailed frequency information, which can be advantageous in tasks that require discrimination based on fine-grained spectral content.\n\n4.6.1.1 MFCCs are particularly strong for:\n\nSpeech Recognition: MFCCs are excellent for identifying phonetic content in speech signals.\nSpeaker Identification: They can be used to distinguish between different speakers based on voice characteristics.\nEmotion Recognition: MFCCs can capture the nuanced variations in speech indicative of emotional states.\nKeyword Spotting: Especially in TinyML, where low computational complexity and small feature size are crucial.\n\n\n\n4.6.1.2 Spectrograms or MFEs are often more suitable for:\n\nMusic Analysis: Spectrograms can capture harmonic and timbral structures in music, which is essential for tasks like genre classification, instrument recognition, or music transcription.\nEnvironmental Sound Classification: In recognizing non-speech, environmental sounds (e.g., rain, wind, traffic), the full spectrogram can provide more discriminative features.\nBirdsong Identification: The intricate details of bird calls are often better captured using spectrograms.\nBioacoustic Signal Processing: In applications like dolphin or bat call analysis, the fine-grained frequency information in a spectrogram can be essential.\nAudio Quality Assurance: Spectrograms are often used in professional audio analysis to identify unwanted noises, clicks, or other artifacts."

Choose the files to be uploaded:\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the Label, select Automatically split between train and test, and Upload data to the EIS. Repeat for all classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset will now appear in the Data acquisition section. Note that the approximately 6,000 samples (1,500 for each class) are split into Train (4,800) and Test (1,200) sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Capturing additional Audio Data\nAlthough we have a lot of data from Pete’s dataset, collecting some words spoken by us is advised. When working with accelerometers, creating a dataset with data captured by the same type of sensor is essential. In the case of sound, this is optional because what we will classify is, in reality, audio data.\n\nThe key difference between sound and audio is the type of energy. Sound is mechanical perturbation (longitudinal sound waves) that propagate through a medium, causing variations of pressure in it. Audio is an electrical (analog or digital) signal representing sound.\n\nWhen we pronounce a keyword, the sound waves should be converted to audio data. The conversion should be done by sampling the signal generated by the microphone at a 16KHz frequency with 16-bit per sample amplitude.\nSo, any device that can generate audio data with this basic specification (16KHz/16bits) will work fine. As a device, we can use the NiclaV, a computer, or even your mobile phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1 Using the NiclaV and the Edge Impulse Studio\nAs we learned in the chapter Setup Nicla Vision, EIS officially supports the Nicla Vision, which simplifies the capture of the data from its sensors, including the microphone. So, please create a new project on EIS and connect the Nicla to it, following these steps:\n\nDownload the last updated EIS Firmware and unzip it.\nOpen the zip file on your computer and select the uploader corresponding to your OS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the NiclaV in Boot Mode by pressing the reset button twice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload the binary arduino-nicla-vision.bin to your board by running the batch code corresponding to your OS.\n\nGo to your project on EIS, and on the Data Acquisition tab, select WebUSB. A window will pop up; choose the option that shows that the Nicla is paired and press [Connect].\nYou can choose which sensor data to pick in the Collect Data section on the Data Acquisition tab. Select: Built-in microphone, define your label (for example, yes), the sampling Frequency[16000Hz], and the Sample length (in milliseconds), for example [10s]. Start sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\nData on Pete’s dataset have a length of 1s, but the recorded samples are 10s long and must be split into 1s samples. Click on three dots after the sample name and select Split sample.\nA window will pop up with the Split tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce inside the tool, split the data into 1-second (1000 ms) records. If necessary, add or remove segments. This procedure should be repeated for all new samples.\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Using a smartphone and the EI Studio\nYou can also use your PC or smartphone to capture audio data, using a sampling frequency of 16KHz and a bit depth of 16.\nGo to Devices, scan the QR Code using your phone, and click on the link. A data Collection app will appear in your browser. Select Collecting Audio, and define your Label, data capture Length, and Category.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the same procedure used with the NiclaV.\n\nNote that any app, such as Audacity, can be used for audio recording, provided you use 16KHz/16-bit depth samples."

    "text": "5.5 Creating Impulse (Pre-Process / Model definition)\nAn impulse takes raw data, uses signal processing to extract features, and then uses a learning block to classify new data.\n\n5.5.1 Impulse Design\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will take the data points with a 1-second window, augmenting the data and sliding that window in 500ms intervals. Note that the option zero-pad data is set. It is essential to fill with ‘zeros’ samples smaller than 1 second (in some cases, some samples can result smaller than the 1000 ms window on the split tool to avoid noise and spikes).\nEach 1-second audio sample should be pre-processed and converted to an image (for example, 13 x 49 x 1). As discussed in the Feature Engineering for Audio Classification Hands-On tutorial, we will use Audio (MFCC), which extracts features from audio signals using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, which are well suited for the human voice, our case here.\nNext, we select the Classification block to build our model from scratch using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Transfer Learning (Keyword Spotting) block, which fine-tunes a pre-trained keyword spotting model on your data. This approach has good performance with relatively small keyword datasets.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Pre-Processing (MFCC)\nThe following step is to create the features to be trained in the next phase:\nWe could keep the default parameter values, but we will use the DSP Autotune parameters option.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will take the Raw features (our 1-second, 16KHz sampled audio data) and use the MFCC processing block to calculate the Processed features. For every 16,000 raw features (16,000 x 1 second), we will get 637 processed features (13 x 49).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result shows that we only used a small amount of memory to pre-process data (16KB) and a latency of 34ms, which is excellent. For example, on an Arduino Nano (Cortex-M4f @ 64MHz), the same pre-process will take around 480ms. The parameters chosen, such as the FFT length [512], will significantly impact the latency.\nNow, let’s Save parameters and move to the Generated features tab, where the actual features will be generated. Using UMAP, a dimension reduction technique, the Feature explorer shows how the features are distributed on a two-dimensional plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result seems OK, with a visually clear separation between yes features (in red) and no features (in blue). The unknown features seem nearer to the no space than the yes. This suggests that the keyword no has more propensity to false positives.\n\n\n5.5.3 Going under the hood\nTo understand better how the raw sound is preprocessed, look at the Feature Engineering for Audio Classification chapter. You can play with the MFCC features generation by downloading this notebook from GitHub or [Opening it In Colab]"

The 1D architecture had a better overall result (90.5% accuracy when compared with 88% of the 2D, so we will use the 1D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing 1D convolutions is more efficient because it requires fewer parameters than 2D convolutions, making them more suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n\nIt is also interesting to pay attention to the 1D Confusion Matrix.

    "section": "6.2 Extracting Features Review",
    "text": "6.2 Extracting Features Review\nExtracting features from a dataset captured with inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, involves processing and analyzing the raw data. Accelerometers measure the acceleration of an object along one or more axes (typically three, denoted as X, Y, and Z). These measurements can be used to understand various aspects of the object’s motion, such as movement patterns and vibrations. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:\nData collection: First, we need to gather data from the accelerometers. Depending on the application, data may be collected at different sampling rates. It’s essential to ensure that the sampling rate is high enough to capture the relevant dynamics of the studied motion (the sampling rate should be at least double the maximum relevant frequency present in the signal).\nData preprocessing: Raw accelerometer data can be noisy and contain errors or irrelevant information. Preprocessing steps, such as filtering and normalization, can help clean and standardize the data, making it more suitable for feature extraction.\n\nThe Studio does not perform normalization or standardization, so sometimes, when working with Sensor Fusion, it could be necessary to perform this step before uploading data to the Studio. This is particularly crucial in sensor fusion projects, as seen in this tutorial, Sensor Data Fusion with Spresense and CommonSense.\n\nSegmentation: Depending on the nature of the data and the application, dividing the data into smaller segments or windows may be necessary. This can help focus on specific events or activities within the dataset, making feature extraction more manageable and meaningful. The window size and overlap (window span) choice depend on the application and the frequency of the events of interest. As a rule of thumb, we should try to capture a couple of “data cycles.”\nFeature extraction: Once the data is preprocessed and segmented, you can extract features that describe the motion’s characteristics. Some typical features extracted from accelerometer data include:\n\nTime-domain features describe the data’s statistical properties within each segment, such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and zero-crossing rate.\nFrequency-domain features are obtained by transforming the data into the frequency domain using techniques like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Some typical frequency-domain features include the power spectrum, spectral energy, dominant frequencies (amplitude and frequency), and spectral entropy.\nTime-frequency domain features combine the time and frequency domain information, such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). They can provide a more detailed understanding of how the signal’s frequency content changes over time.\n\nIn many cases, the number of extracted features can be large, which may lead to overfitting or increased computational complexity. Feature selection techniques, such as mutual information, correlation-based methods, or principal component analysis (PCA), can help identify the most relevant features for a given application and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The Studio can help with such feature-relevant calculations.\nLet’s explore in more detail a typical TinyML Motion Classification project covered in this series of Hands-Ons."

The project captured accelerometer data every 10 seconds with a sample rate of 62.5 Hz. A 2-second window captures 375 data points (3 axis x 2 seconds x 62.5 samples). The window is slid every 80ms, creating a larger dataset where each instance has 375 “raw features.”\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Studio, the previous version (V1) of the Spectral Analysis Block extracted as time-domain features only the RMS, and for the frequency-domain, the peaks and frequency (using FFT) and the power characteristics (PSD) of the signal over time resulting in a fixed tabular dataset of 33 features (11 per each axis),\n\n\n\n\n\nThose 33 features were the Input tensor of a Neural Network Classifier.\nIn 2022, Edge Impulse released version 2 of the Spectral Analysis block, which we will explore here.\n\n6.4.1 Edge Impulse - Spectral Analysis Block V.2 under the hood\nIn Version 2, Time Domain Statistical features per axis/channel are:\n\nRMS\nSkewness\nKurtosis\n\nAnd the Frequency Domain Spectral features per axis/channel are:\n\nSpectral Power\nSkewness (in the next version)\nKurtosis (in the next version)\n\nIn this link, we can have more details about the feature extraction.\n\nClone the public project. You can also follow the explanation, playing with the code using my Google CoLab Notebook: Edge Impulse Spectral Analysis Block Notebook.\n\nStart importing the libraries:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport math\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\nfrom scipy import signal\nfrom scipy.signal import welch\nfrom scipy.stats import entropy\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport pywt\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 6)\nplt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 3\nFrom the studied project, let’s choose a data sample from accelerometers as below:\n\nWindow size of 2 seconds: [2,000] ms\nSample frequency: [62.5] Hz\nWe will choose the [None] filter (for simplicity) and a\nFFT length: [16].\n\nf =  62.5 # Hertz\nwind_sec = 2 # seconds\nFFT_Lenght = 16\naxis = ['accX', 'accY', 'accZ']\nn_sensors = len(axis)\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the Raw Features on the Studio Spectral Analysis tab, we can copy all 375 data points of a particular 2-second window to the clipboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste the data points to a new variable data:\ndata=[-5.6330, 0.2376, 9.8701, -5.9442, 0.4830, 9.8701, -5.4217, ...]\nNo_raw_features = len(data)\nN = int(No_raw_features/n_sensors)\nThe total raw features are 375, but we will work with each axis individually, where N= 125 (number of samples per axis).\nWe aim to understand how Edge Impulse gets the processed features.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, you should also past the processed features on a variable (to compare the calculated features in Python with the ones provided by the Studio) :\nfeatures = [2.7322, -0.0978, -0.3813, 2.3980, 3.8924, 24.6841, 9.6303, ...]\nN_feat = len(features)\nN_feat_axis = int(N_feat/n_sensors)\nThe total number of processed features is 39, which means 13 features/axis.\nLooking at those 13 features closely, we will find 3 for the time domain (RMS, Skewness, and Kurtosis):\n\n[rms] [skew] [kurtosis]\n\nand 10 for the frequency domain (we will return to this later).\n\n[spectral skew][spectral kurtosis][Spectral Power 1] ... [Spectral Power 8]\n\nSplitting raw data per sensor\nThe data has samples from all axes; let’s split and plot them separately:\ndef plot_data(sensors, axis, title):\n    [plt.plot(x, label=y) for x,y in zip(sensors, axis)]\n    plt.legend(loc='lower right')\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.xlabel('#Sample')\n    plt.ylabel('Value')\n    plt.box(False)\n    plt.grid()\n    plt.show()\n\naccX = data[0::3]\naccY = data[1::3]\naccZ = data[2::3]\nsensors = [accX, accY, accZ] \nplot_data(sensors, axis, 'Raw Features')\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtracting the mean\nNext, we should subtract the mean from the data. Subtracting the mean from a data set is a common data pre-processing step in statistics and machine learning. The purpose of subtracting the mean from the data is to center the data around zero. This is important because it can reveal patterns and relationships that might be hidden if the data is not centered.\nHere are some specific reasons why subtracting the mean can be helpful:\n\nIt simplifies analysis: By centering the data, the mean becomes zero, making some calculations simpler and easier to interpret.\nIt removes bias: If the data is biased, subtracting the mean can remove it and allow for a more accurate analysis.\nIt can reveal patterns: Centering the data can help uncover patterns that might be hidden if the data is not centered. For example, centering the data can help you identify trends over time if you analyze a time series dataset.\nIt can improve performance: In some machine learning algorithms, centering the data can improve performance by reducing the influence of outliers and making the data more easily comparable. Overall, subtracting the mean is a simple but powerful technique that can be used to improve the analysis and interpretation of data.\n\ndtmean = [(sum(x)/len(x)) for x in sensors]\n[print('mean_'+x+'= ', round(y, 4)) for x,y in zip(axis, dtmean)][0]\n\naccX = [(x - dtmean[0]) for x in accX]\naccY = [(x - dtmean[1]) for x in accY]\naccZ = [(x - dtmean[2]) for x in accZ]\nsensors = [accX, accY, accZ]\n\nplot_data(sensors, axis, 'Raw Features - Subctract the Mean')"

This determines the number of FFT bins and the resolution of frequency peaks that can be separated. A low number means more signals will average together in the same FFT bin, but it also reduces the number of features and model size.

    "text": "6.7 Time-frequency domain\n\n6.7.1 Wavelets\nWavelet is a powerful technique for analyzing signals with transient features or abrupt changes, such as spikes or edges, which are difficult to interpret with traditional Fourier-based methods.\nWavelet transforms work by breaking down a signal into different frequency components and analyzing them individually. The transformation is achieved by convolving the signal with a wavelet function, a small waveform centered at a specific time and frequency. This process effectively decomposes the signal into different frequency bands, each of which can be analyzed separately.\nOne of the critical benefits of wavelet transforms is that they allow for time-frequency analysis, which means that they can reveal the frequency content of a signal as it changes over time. This makes them particularly useful for analyzing non-stationary signals, which vary over time.\nWavelets have many practical applications, including signal and image compression, denoising, feature extraction, and image processing.\nLet’s select Wavelet on the Spectral Features block in the same project:\n\nType: Wavelet\nWavelet Decomposition Level: 1\nWavelet: bior1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wavelet Function\nwavelet_name='bior1.3'\nnum_layer = 1\n\nwavelet = pywt.Wavelet(wavelet_name)\n[phi_d,psi_d,phi_r,psi_r,x] = wavelet.wavefun(level=5)\nplt.plot(x, psi_d, color='red')\nplt.title('Wavelet Function')\nplt.ylabel('Value')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.grid()\nplt.box(False)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did before, let’s copy and past the Processed Features:\n\n\n\n\n\nfeatures = [3.6251, 0.0615, 0.0615, -7.3517, -2.7641, 2.8462, 5.0924, ...]\nN_feat = len(features)\nN_feat_axis = int(N_feat/n_sensors)\nEdge Impulse computes the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for each one of the Wavelet Decomposition levels selected. After that, the features will be extracted.\nIn the case of Wavelets, the extracted features are basic statistical values, crossing values, and entropy. There are, in total, 14 features per layer as below:\n\n[11] Statiscal Features: n5, n25, n75, n95, mean, median, standard deviation (std), variance (var) root mean square (rms), kurtosis, and skewness (skew).\n[2] Crossing Features: Zero crossing rate (zcross) and mean crossing rate (mcross) are the times that the signal passes through the baseline (y = 0) and the average level (y = u) per unit of time, respectively\n[1] Complexity Feature: Entropy is a characteristic measure of the complexity of the signal\n\nAll the above 14 values are calculated for each Layer (including L0, the original signal)\n\nThe total number of features varies depending on how you set the filter and the number of layers. For example, with [None] filtering and Level[1], the number of features per axis will be 14 x 2 (L0 and L1) = 28. For the three axes, we will have a total of 84 features.\n\n\n\n6.7.2 Wavelet Analysis\nWavelet analysis decomposes the signal (accX, accY, and accZ) into different frequency components using a set of filters, which separate these components into low-frequency (slowly varying parts of the signal containing long-term patterns), such as accX_l1, accY_l1, accZ_l1 and, high-frequency (rapidly varying parts of the signal containing short-term patterns) components, such as accX_d1, accY_d1, accZ_d1, permitting the extraction of features for further analysis or classification.\nOnly the low-frequency components (approximation coefficients, or cA) will be used. In this example, we assume only one level (Single-level Discrete Wavelet Transform), where the function will return a tuple. With a multilevel decomposition, the “Multilevel 1D Discrete Wavelet Transform”, the result will be a list (for detail, please see: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) )\n(accX_l1, accX_d1) = pywt.dwt(accX, wavelet_name)\n(accY_l1, accY_d1) = pywt.dwt(accY, wavelet_name)\n(accZ_l1, accZ_d1) = pywt.dwt(accZ, wavelet_name)\nsensors_l1 = [accX_l1, accY_l1, accZ_l1]\n\n# Plot power spectrum versus frequency\nplt.plot(accX_l1, label='accX')\nplt.plot(accY_l1, label='accY')\nplt.plot(accZ_l1, label='accZ')\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Value')\nplt.title('Wavelet Approximation')\nplt.grid()\nplt.box(False)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3 Feature Extraction\nLet’s start with the basic statistical features. Note that we apply the function for both the original signals and the resultant cAs from the DWT:\ndef calculate_statistics(signal):\n    n5 = np.percentile(signal, 5)\n    n25 = np.percentile(signal, 25)\n    n75 = np.percentile(signal, 75)\n    n95 = np.percentile(signal, 95)\n    median = np.percentile(signal, 50)\n    mean = np.mean(signal)\n    std = np.std(signal)\n    var = np.var(signal)\n    rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square(signal)))\n    return [n5, n25, n75, n95, median, mean, std, var, rms]\n \nstat_feat_l0 = [calculate_statistics(x) for x in sensors]\nstat_feat_l1 = [calculate_statistics(x) for x in sensors_l1]\nThe Skelness and Kurtosis:\nskew_l0 = [skew(x, bias=False) for x in sensors]\nskew_l1 = [skew(x, bias=False) for x in sensors_l1]\nkurtosis_l0 = [kurtosis(x, bias=False) for x in sensors]\nkurtosis_l1 = [kurtosis(x, bias=False) for x in sensors_l1]\nZero crossing (zcross) is the number of times the wavelet coefficient crosses the zero axis. It can be used to measure the signal’s frequency content since high-frequency signals tend to have more zero crossings than low-frequency signals.\nMean crossing (mcross), on the other hand, is the number of times the wavelet coefficient crosses the mean of the signal. It can be used to measure the amplitude since high-amplitude signals tend to have more mean crossings than low-amplitude signals.\ndef getZeroCrossingRate(arr):\n    my_array = np.array(arr)\n    zcross = float(\"{0:.2f}\".format((((my_array[:-1] * my_array[1:]) &lt; 0).su    m())/len(arr)))\n    return zcross\n\ndef getMeanCrossingRate(arr):\n    mcross = getZeroCrossingRate(np.array(arr) - np.mean(arr))\n    return mcross\n\ndef calculate_crossings(list):\n    zcross=[]\n    mcross=[]\n    for i in range(len(list)):\n        zcross_i = getZeroCrossingRate(list[i])\n        zcross.append(zcross_i)\n        mcross_i = getMeanCrossingRate(list[i])\n        mcross.append(mcross_i)\n    return zcross, mcross\n\ncross_l0 = calculate_crossings(sensors)\ncross_l1 = calculate_crossings(sensors_l1)\nIn wavelet analysis, entropy refers to the degree of disorder or randomness in the distribution of wavelet coefficients. Here, we used Shannon entropy, which measures a signal’s uncertainty or randomness. It is calculated as the negative sum of the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of the signal multiplied by their base 2 logarithm. In the context of wavelet analysis, Shannon entropy can be used to measure the complexity of the signal, with higher values indicating greater complexity.\ndef calculate_entropy(signal, base=None):\n    value, counts = np.unique(signal, return_counts=True)\n    return entropy(counts, base=base)\n\nentropy_l0 = [calculate_entropy(x) for x in sensors]\nentropy_l1 = [calculate_entropy(x) for x in sensors_l1]\nLet’s now list all the wavelet features and create a list by layers.\nL1_features_names = [\"L1-n5\", \"L1-n25\", \"L1-n75\", \"L1-n95\", \"L1-median\", \"L1-mean\", \"L1-std\", \"L1-var\", \"L1-rms\", \"L1-skew\", \"L1-Kurtosis\", \"L1-zcross\", \"L1-mcross\", \"L1-entropy\"]\n\nL0_features_names = [\"L0-n5\", \"L0-n25\", \"L0-n75\", \"L0-n95\", \"L0-median\", \"L0-mean\", \"L0-std\", \"L0-var\", \"L0-rms\", \"L0-skew\", \"L0-Kurtosis\", \"L0-zcross\", \"L0-mcross\", \"L0-entropy\"]\n\nall_feat_l0 = []\nfor i in range(len(axis)):\n    feat_l0 = stat_feat_l0[i]+[skew_l0[i]]+[kurtosis_l0[i]]+[cross_l0[0][i]]+[cross_l0[1][i]]+[entropy_l0[i]]\n    [print(axis[i]+' '+x+'= ', round(y, 4)) for x,y in zip(L0_features_names, feat_l0)][0]\n    all_feat_l0.append(feat_l0)\nall_feat_l0 = [item for sublist in all_feat_l0 for item in sublist]\nprint(f\"\\nAll L0 Features = {len(all_feat_l0)}\")\n\nall_feat_l1 = []\nfor i in range(len(axis)):\nfeat_l1 = stat_feat_l1[i]+[skew_l1[i]]+[kurtosis_l1[i]]+[cross_l1[0][i]]+[cross_l1[1][i]]+[entropy_l1[i]]\n[print(axis[i]+' '+x+'= ', round(y, 4)) for x,y in zip(L1_features_names, feat_l1)][0]\nall_feat_l1.append(feat_l1)\nall_feat_l1 = [item for sublist in all_feat_l1 for item in sublist]\nprint(f\"\\nAll L1 Features = {len(all_feat_l1)}\")"

    "text": "7.2 IMU Installation and testing\nFor this project, we will use an accelerometer. As discussed in the Hands-On Tutorial, Setup Nicla Vision, the Nicla Vision Board has an onboard 6-axis IMU: 3D gyroscope and 3D accelerometer, the LSM6DSOX. Let’s verify if the LSM6DSOX IMU library is installed. If not, install it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, go to Examples &gt; Arduino_LSM6DSOX &gt; SimpleAccelerometer and run the accelerometer test. You can check if it works by opening the IDE Serial Monitor or Plotter. The values are in g (earth gravity), with a default range of +/- 4g:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1 Defining the Sampling frequency:\nChoosing an appropriate sampling frequency is crucial for capturing the motion characteristics you’re interested in studying. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that the sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal to reconstruct it properly. In the context of motion classification and anomaly detection for transportation, the choice of sampling frequency would depend on several factors:\n\nNature of the Motion: Different types of transportation (terrestrial, maritime, etc.) may involve different ranges of motion frequencies. Faster movements may require higher sampling frequencies.\nHardware Limitations: The Arduino Nicla Vision board and any associated sensors may have limitations on how fast they can sample data.\nComputational Resources: Higher sampling rates will generate more data, which might be computationally intensive, especially critical in a TinyML environment.\nBattery Life: A higher sampling rate will consume more power. If the system is battery-operated, this is an important consideration.\nData Storage: More frequent sampling will require more storage space, another crucial consideration for embedded systems with limited memory.\n\nIn many human activity recognition tasks, sampling rates of around 50 Hz to 100 Hz are commonly used. Given that we are simulating transportation scenarios, which are generally not high-frequency events, a sampling rate in that range (50-100 Hz) might be a reasonable starting point.\nLet’s define a sketch that will allow us to capture our data with a defined sampling frequency (for example, 50Hz):\n/*\n * Based on Edge Impulse Data Forwarder Example (Arduino)\n  - https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-data-forwarder\n * Developed by M.Rovai @11May23\n */\n\n/* Include ----------------------------------------------------------------- */\n#include &lt;Arduino_LSM6DSOX.h&gt;\n\n/* Constant defines -------------------------------------------------------- */\n#define CONVERT_G_TO_MS2 9.80665f\n#define FREQUENCY_HZ        50\n#define INTERVAL_MS         (1000 / (FREQUENCY_HZ + 1))\n\nstatic unsigned long last_interval_ms = 0;\nfloat x, y, z;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  while (!Serial);\n\n  if (!IMU.begin()) {\n    Serial.println(\"Failed to initialize IMU!\");\n    while (1);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (millis() &gt; last_interval_ms + INTERVAL_MS) {\n    last_interval_ms = millis();\n    \n    if (IMU.accelerationAvailable()) {\n      // Read raw acceleration measurements from the device\n      IMU.readAcceleration(x, y, z);\n\n      // converting to m/s2\n      float ax_m_s2 = x * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2;\n      float ay_m_s2 = y * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2;\n      float az_m_s2 = z * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2;\n\n      Serial.print(ax_m_s2); \n      Serial.print(\"\\t\");\n      Serial.print(ay_m_s2); \n      Serial.print(\"\\t\");\n      Serial.println(az_m_s2); \n    }\n  }\n}\nUploading the sketch and inspecting the Serial Monitor, we can see that we are capturing 50 samples per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that with the Nicla board resting on a table (with the camera facing down), the z-axis measures around 9.8m/s\\(^2\\), the expected earth acceleration."

Data can also be sent remotely to a nearby repository, such as a mobile phone, using Bluetooth (as done in this project: Sensor DataLogger). Once your dataset is collected and stored as a .CSV file, it can be uploaded to the Studio using the CSV Wizard tool.\n\nIn this video, you can learn alternative ways to send data to the Edge Impulse Studio.\n\n\n7.4.1 Connecting the device to Edge Impulse\nWe will connect the Nicla directly to the Edge Impulse Studio, which will also be used for data pre-processing, model training, testing, and deployment. For that, you have two options:\n\nDownload the latest firmware and connect it directly to the Data Collection section.\nUse the CLI Data Forwarder tool to capture sensor data from the sensor and send it to the Studio.\n\nOption 1 is more straightforward, as we saw in the Setup Nicla Vision hands-on, but option 2 will give you more flexibility regarding capturing your data, such as sampling frequency definition. Let’s do it with the last one.\nPlease create a new project on the Edge Impulse Studio (EIS) and connect the Nicla to it, following these steps:\n\nInstall the Edge Impulse CLI and the Node.js into your computer.\nUpload a sketch for data capture (the one discussed previously in this tutorial).\nUse the CLI Data Forwarder to capture data from the Nicla’s accelerometer and send it to the Studio, as shown in this diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the CLI Data Forwarder on your terminal, entering (if it is the first time) the following command:\n$ edge-impulse-data-forwarder --clean\nNext, enter your EI credentials and choose your project, variables (for example, accX, accY, and accZ), and device name (for example, NiclaV:\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Devices section on your EI Project and verify if the device is connected (the dot should be green):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can clone the project developed for this hands-on: NICLA Vision Movement Classification.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Data Collection\nOn the Data Acquisition section, you should see that your board [NiclaV] is connected. The sensor is available: [sensor with 3 axes (accX, accY, accZ)] with a sampling frequency of [50Hz]. The Studio suggests a sample length of [10000] ms (10s). The last thing left is defining the sample label. Let’s start with[terrestrial]:\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrestrial (palettes in a Truck or Train), moving horizontally. Press [Start Sample]and move your device horizontally, keeping one direction over your table. After 10 s, your data will be uploaded to the studio. Here is how the sample was collected:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the movement was captured mainly in the Y-axis (green). In the blue, we see the Z axis, around -10 m/s\\(^2\\) (the Nicla has the camera facing up).\nAs discussed before, we should capture data from all four Transportation Classes. So, imagine that you have a container with a built-in accelerometer facing the following situations:\nMaritime (pallets in boats into an angry ocean). The movement is captured on all three axes:\n\n\n\n\n\nLift (Palettes being handled vertically by a Forklift). Movement captured only in the Z-axis:\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle (Paletts in a warehouse). No movement detected by the accelerometer:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can capture, for example, 2 minutes (twelve samples of 10 seconds) for each of the four classes (a total of 8 minutes of data). Using the three dots menu after each one of the samples, select 2 of them, reserving them for the Test set. Alternatively, you can use the automatic Train/Test Split tool on the Danger Zone of Dashboard tab. Below, you can see the resulting dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have captured your dataset, you can explore it in more detail using the Data Explorer, a visual tool to find outliers or mislabeled data (helping to correct them). The data explorer first tries to extract meaningful features from your data (by applying signal processing and neural network embeddings) and then uses a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as PCA or t-SNE to map these features to a 2D space. This gives you a one-look overview of your complete dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our case, the dataset seems OK (good separation). But the PCA shows we can have issues between maritime (green) and lift (orange). This is expected, once on a boat, sometimes the movement can be only “vertical”."

    "section": "7.5 Impulse Design",
    "text": "7.5 Impulse Design\nThe next step is the definition of our Impulse, which takes the raw data and uses signal processing to extract features, passing them as the input tensor of a learning block to classify new data. Go to Impulse Design and Create Impulse. The Studio will suggest the basic design. Let’s also add a second Learning Block for Anomaly Detection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second model uses a K-means model. If we imagine that we could have our known classes as clusters, any sample that could not fit on that could be an outlier, an anomaly such as a container rolling out of a ship on the ocean or falling from a Forklift.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling frequency should be automatically captured, if not, enter it: [50]Hz. The Studio suggests a Window Size of 2 seconds ([2000] ms) with a sliding window of [20]ms. What we are defining in this step is that we will pre-process the captured data (Time-Seres data), creating a tabular dataset features) that will be the input for a Neural Networks Classifier (DNN) and an Anomaly Detection model (K-Means), as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dig into those steps and parameters to understand better what we are doing here.\n\n7.5.1 Data Pre-Processing Overview\nData pre-processing is extracting features from the dataset captured with the accelerometer, which involves processing and analyzing the raw data. Accelerometers measure the acceleration of an object along one or more axes (typically three, denoted as X, Y, and Z). These measurements can be used to understand various aspects of the object’s motion, such as movement patterns and vibrations.\nRaw accelerometer data can be noisy and contain errors or irrelevant information. Preprocessing steps, such as filtering and normalization, can clean and standardize the data, making it more suitable for feature extraction. In our case, we should divide the data into smaller segments or windows. This can help focus on specific events or activities within the dataset, making feature extraction more manageable and meaningful. The window size and overlap (window increase) choice depend on the application and the frequency of the events of interest. As a thumb rule, we should try to capture a couple of “cycles of data”.\n\nWith a sampling rate (SR) of 50Hz and a window size of 2 seconds, we will get 100 samples per axis, or 300 in total (3 axis x 2 seconds x 50 samples). We will slide this window every 200ms, creating a larger dataset where each instance has 300 raw features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the data is preprocessed and segmented, you can extract features that describe the motion’s characteristics. Some typical features extracted from accelerometer data include:\n\nTime-domain features describe the data’s statistical properties within each segment, such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and zero-crossing rate.\nFrequency-domain features are obtained by transforming the data into the frequency domain using techniques like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Some typical frequency-domain features include the power spectrum, spectral energy, dominant frequencies (amplitude and frequency), and spectral entropy.\nTime-frequency domain features combine the time and frequency domain information, such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). They can provide a more detailed understanding of how the signal’s frequency content changes over time.\n\nIn many cases, the number of extracted features can be large, which may lead to overfitting or increased computational complexity. Feature selection techniques, such as mutual information, correlation-based methods, or principal component analysis (PCA), can help identify the most relevant features for a given application and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The Studio can help with such feature importance calculations.\n\n\n7.5.2 EI Studio Spectral Features\nData preprocessing is a challenging area for embedded machine learning, still, Edge Impulse helps overcome this with its digital signal processing (DSP) preprocessing step and, more specifically, the Spectral Features Block.\nOn the Studio, the collected raw dataset will be the input of a Spectral Analysis block, which is excellent for analyzing repetitive motion, such as data from accelerometers. This block will perform a DSP (Digital Signal Processing), extracting features such as FFT or Wavelets.\nFor our project, once the time signal is continuous, we should use FFT with, for example, a length of [32].\nThe per axis/channel Time Domain Statistical features are:\n\nRMS: 1 feature\nSkewness: 1 feature\nKurtosis: 1 feature\n\nThe per axis/channel Frequency Domain Spectral features are:\n\nSpectral Power: 16 features (FFT Length/2)\nSkewness: 1 feature\nKurtosis: 1 feature\n\nSo, for an FFT length of 32 points, the resulting output of the Spectral Analysis Block will be 21 features per axis (a total of 63 features).\n\nYou can learn more about how each feature is calculated by downloading the notebook Edge Impulse - Spectral Features Block Analysis TinyML under the hood: Spectral Analysis or opening it directly on Google CoLab.\n\n\n\n7.5.3 Generating features\nOnce we understand what the pre-processing does, it is time to finish the job. So, let’s take the raw data (time-series type) and convert it to tabular data. For that, go to the Spectral Features section on the Parameters tab, define the main parameters as discussed in the previous section ([FFT] with [32] points), and select[Save Parameters]:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top menu, select the Generate Features option and the Generate Features button. Each 2-second window data will be converted into one data point of 63 features.\n\nThe Feature Explorer will show those data in 2D using UMAP. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualization similarly to t-SNE but is also applicable for general non-linear dimension reduction.\n\nThe visualization makes it possible to verify that after the feature generation, the classes present keep their excellent separation, which indicates that the classifier should work well. Optionally, you can analyze how important each one of the features is for one class compared with others."

You can always work to improve the results, for example, to understand what went wrong with one of the wrong results. If it is a unique situation, you can add it to the training dataset and then repeat it.\nThe default minimum threshold for a considered uncertain result is [0.6] for classification and [0.3] for anomaly. Once we have four classes (their output sum should be 1.0), you can also set up a lower threshold for a class to be considered valid (for example, 0.4).

The Studio will package all the needed libraries, preprocessing functions, and trained models, downloading them to your computer. You should select the option Arduino Library, and at the bottom, you can choose Quantized (Int8) or Unoptimized (float32) and [Build]. A Zip file will be created and downloaded to your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your Arduino IDE, go to the Sketch tab, select Add.ZIP Library, and Choose the.zip file downloaded by the Studio. A message will appear in the IDE Terminal: Library installed.\n\n7.8.1 Inference\nNow, it is time for a real test. We will make inferences wholly disconnected from the Studio. Let’s change one of the code examples created when you deploy the Arduino Library.\nIn your Arduino IDE, go to the File/Examples tab and look for your project, and on examples, select Nicla_vision_fusion:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the code created by Edge Impulse considers a sensor fusion approach where the IMU (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) and the ToF are used. At the beginning of the code, you have the libraries related to our project, IMU and ToF:\n/* Includes ---------------------------------------------------------------- */\n#include &lt;NICLA_Vision_Movement_Classification_inferencing.h&gt; \n#include &lt;Arduino_LSM6DSOX.h&gt; //IMU\n#include \"VL53L1X.h\" // ToF\n\nYou can keep the code this way for testing because the trained model will use only features pre-processed from the accelerometer. But consider that you will write your code only with the needed libraries for a real project.\n\nAnd that is it!\nYou can now upload the code to your device and proceed with the inferences. Press the Nicla [RESET] button twice to put it on boot mode (disconnect from the Studio if it is still connected), and upload the sketch to your board.\nNow you should try different movements with your board (similar to those done during data capture), observing the inference result of each class on the Serial Monitor:\n\nIdle and lift classes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaritime and terrestrial:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in all situations above, the value of the anomaly score was smaller than 0.0. Try a new movement that was not part of the original dataset, for example, “rolling” the Nicla, facing the camera upside-down, as a container falling from a boat or even a boat accident:\n\nanomaly detection:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the anomaly is much bigger, over 1.00\n\n\n7.8.2 Post-processing\nNow that we know the model is working since it detects the movements, we suggest that you modify the code to see the result with the NiclaV completely offline (disconnected from the PC and powered by a battery, a power bank, or an independent 5V power supply).\nThe idea is to do the same as with the KWS project: if one specific movement is detected, a specific LED could be lit. For example, if terrestrial is detected, the Green LED will light; if maritime, the Red LED will light, if it is a lift, the Blue LED will light; and if no movement is detected (idle), the LEDs will be OFF. You can also add a condition when an anomaly is detected, in this case, for example, a white color can be used (all e LEDs light simultaneously)."

Its small form factor and efficiency in processing make it an ideal choice for deploying portable and remote applications where real-time processing is crucial and connectivity may be limited."
