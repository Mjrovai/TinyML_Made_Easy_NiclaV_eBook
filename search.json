Nowadays there is a deluge of information, but it is not easy to determine what can and what cannot be trusted. A good pointer is to look for the credentials and the affiliation of the author of a document, or that of the associated institutions. Since 1992 EsLaRed has been providing training in different aspects of Information Technologies in Latin America and the Caribbean, always striving to provide accurate and timely training materials, which have evolved accordingly to shifts in the technology focus. IoT and Machine Learning are poised to play a pivotal role, so the work of Professor Marcelo Rovai addressing Tiny Machine Learning is both timely and authoritative, in this rapidly changing field.\nTinyML Made Easy is exactly what the title means. Written in a clear and concise style, with emphasis on practical applications and examples, drawing from many years of experience and overwhelming enthusiasm in sharing his knowledge, there is no doubt that Marcelo’s work is a very significant contribution to this very interesting field. The knowledge acquired doing the exercises will enable the readers to undertake other projects that might interest them.\nErmanno Pietrosemoli, President Fundación Escuela Latinoamericana de Redes\nOctober 2023."

    "text": "Microcontrollers (MCUs) are cheap electronic components, usually with just a few kilobytes of RAM, and designed to consume small amounts of power. Today, MCUs can be found embedded in all residential, medical, automotive, and industrial devices. Over 40 billion microcontrollers are estimated to be marketed annually, and hundreds of billions are currently in service. But, curiously, these devices receive little attention because, many times, they are used just to replace functionalities that older electromechanical systems face in cars, washing machines, or remote controls.\nMore recently, with the era of IoT (Internet of Things), a significant part of these MCUs is generating “quintillions” of data, which, in their majority, are not used due to the high cost and complexity of their data transmission (bandwidth and latency).\nOn the other hand, in the last decades, we have witnessed the development of Machine Learning models (sub-area of Artificial Intelligence) trained with “tons” of data and powerful mainframes. But now, it suddenly becomes possible for “noisy” and complex signals, such as images, audio, or accelerometers, to extract meaning from the same through neural networks. More importantly, we can execute these models of neural networks in microcontrollers and sensors using very little energy and extract much more meaning from the data generated by these sensors, which we are currently ignoring.\n\nTinyML, a new area of Applied AI, allows extracting “machine intelligence” from the physical world (where the data is generated).\n\nThe WALC 2023 Applied AI Track is an introductory course on the intersection between Machine Learning and Embedded Devices. The spread of embedded devices with ultra-low power consumption (on the order of milliwatts), together with the introduction of machine learning frameworks dedicated to embedded devices, such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TF Lite Micro), allow the mass proliferation of IoT devices empowered by AI (“AioT”)."

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe Arduino Nicla Vision (sometimes called NiclaV) is a development board that includes two processors that can run tasks in parallel. It is part of a family of development boards with the same form factor but designed for specific tasks, such as the Nicla Sense ME and the Nicla Voice. The Niclas can efficiently run processes created with TensorFlow™ Lite. For example, one of the cores of the NiclaV runs a computer vision algorithm on the fly (inference), while the other executes low-level operations like controlling a motor and communicating or acting as a user interface. The onboard wireless module allows the management of WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity simultaneously."

The NiclaV board can host up to 16 MB of QSPI Flash for storage. However, it is essential to consider that the MCU SRAM is the one to be used with machine learning inferences; the STM32H747 is only 1MB, shared by both processors. This MCU also has incorporated 2MB of FLASH, mainly for code storage.\n\n\n1.2.3 Sensors\n\nCamera: A GC2145 2 MP Color CMOS Camera.\nMicrophone: The MP34DT05 is an ultra-compact, low-power, omnidirectional, digital MEMS microphone built with a capacitive sensing element and the IC interface.\n6-Axis IMU: 3D gyroscope and 3D accelerometer data from the LSM6DSOX 6-axis IMU.\nTime of Flight Sensor: The VL53L1CBV0FY Time-of-Flight sensor adds accurate and low power-ranging capabilities to the Nicla Vision. The invisible near-infrared VCSEL laser (including the analog driver) is encapsulated with receiving optics in an all-in-one small module below the camera."

All connectors are 5V compatible.\n\nNote that all 17 Nicla Vision pins will be connected to the Shield Groves, but some Grove connections remain disconnected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shield is MKR compatible and can be used with the Nicla Vision and Portenta.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose that on a TinyML project, you want to send inference results using a LoRaWAN device and add information about local luminosity. Often, with offline operations, a local low-power display such as an OLED is advised. This setup can be seen here:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grove Light Sensor would be connected to one of the single Analog pins (A0/PC4), the LoRaWAN device to the UART, and the OLED to the I2C connector.\nThe Nicla Pins 3 (Tx) and 4 (Rx) are connected with the Serial Shield connector. The UART communication is used with the LoRaWan device.

Here is the code.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the Hello World code to be used with the I2C OLED. The MicroPython SSD1306 OLED driver (ssd1306.py), created by Adafruit, should also be uploaded to the Nicla (the ssd1306.py script can be found in GitHub).\n# Nicla_OLED_Hello_World - By: marcelo_rovai - Sat Sep 30 2023\n\n#Save on device: MicroPython SSD1306 OLED driver, I2C and SPI interfaces created by Adafruit\nimport ssd1306\n\nfrom machine import I2C\ni2c = I2C(1)\n\noled_width = 128\noled_height = 64\noled = ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(oled_width, oled_height, i2c)\n\noled.text('Hello, World', 10, 10)\noled.show()\nFinally, here is a simple script to read the ADC value on pin “PC4” (Nicla pin A0):\n\n# Light Sensor (A0) - By: marcelo_rovai - Wed Oct 4 2023\n\nimport pyb\nfrom time import sleep\n\nadc = pyb.ADC(pyb.Pin(\"PC4\"))     # create an analog object from a pin\nval = adc.read()                  # read an analog value\n\nwhile (True):\n\n    val = adc.read()  \n    print (\"Light={}\".format (val))\n    sleep (1)\nThe ADC can be used for other sensor variables, such as Temperature.\n\nNote that the above scripts (downloaded from Github) introduce only how to connect external devices with the Nicla Vision board using MicroPython."

MobileNets are small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of various use cases. in 2018, Google launched MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks.\nMobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2 aim at mobile efficiency and embedded vision applications but differ in architectural complexity and performance. While both use depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the computational cost, MobileNet V2 introduces Inverted Residual Blocks and Linear Bottlenecks to enhance performance. These new features allow V2 to capture more complex features using fewer parameters, making it computationally more efficient and generally more accurate than its predecessor. Additionally, V2 employs a non-linear activation in the intermediate expansion layer. It still uses a linear activation for the bottleneck layer, a design choice found to preserve important information through the network. MobileNet V2 offers an optimized architecture for higher accuracy and efficiency and will be used in this project.\nAlthough the base MobileNet architecture is already tiny and has low latency, many times, a specific use case or application may require the model to be even smaller and faster. MobileNets introduces a straightforward parameter α (alpha) called width multiplier to construct these smaller, less computationally expensive models. The role of the width multiplier α is that of thinning a network uniformly at each layer.\nEdge Impulse Studio can use both MobileNetV1 (96x96 images) and V2 (96x96 or 160x160 images), with several different α values (from 0.05 to 1.0). For example, you will get the highest accuracy with V2, 160x160 images, and α=1.0. Of course, there is a trade-off. The higher the accuracy, the more memory (around 1.3MB RAM and 2.6MB ROM) will be needed to run the model, implying more latency. The smaller footprint will be obtained at the other extreme with MobileNetV1 and α=0.10 (around 53.2K RAM and 101K ROM).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use MobileNetV2 96x96 0.1 for this project, with an estimated memory cost of 265.3 KB in RAM. This model should be OK for the Nicla Vision with 1MB of SRAM. On the Transfer Learning Tab, select this model:"

Data augmentation is a method to improve the accuracy of machine learning models by creating additional artificial data. A data augmentation system makes small, random changes to your training data during the training process (such as flipping, cropping, or rotating the images).\nLooking under the hood, here you can see how Edge Impulse implements a data Augmentation policy on your data:\n# Implements the data augmentation policy\ndef augment_image(image, label):\n    # Flips the image randomly\n    image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image)\n\n    # Increase the image size, then randomly crop it down to\n    # the original dimensions\n    resize_factor = random.uniform(1, 1.2)\n    new_height = math.floor(resize_factor * INPUT_SHAPE[0])\n    new_width = math.floor(resize_factor * INPUT_SHAPE[1])\n    image = tf.image.resize_with_crop_or_pad(image, new_height, new_width)\n    image = tf.image.random_crop(image, size=INPUT_SHAPE)\n\n    # Vary the brightness of the image\n    image = tf.image.random_brightness(image, max_delta=0.2)\n\n    return image, label\nExposure to these variations during training can help prevent your model from taking shortcuts by “memorizing” superficial clues in your training data, meaning it may better reflect the deep underlying patterns in your dataset.\nThe final layer of our model will have 12 neurons with a 15% dropout for overfitting prevention. Here is the Training result:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is excellent, with 77ms of latency, which should result in 13fps (frames per second) during inference."

In the code, this allocation was changed to 288 kB to guarantee that the model will run on the device (malloc_addblock((void*)0x30000000, 288 * 1024);).\n\nThe result is good, with 86ms of measured latency.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short video showing the inference results: \n\n\n2.10.2 OpenMV\nIt is possible to deploy the trained model to be used with OpenMV in two ways: as a library and as a firmware.\nThree files are generated as a library: the trained.tflite model, a list with labels, and a simple MicroPython script that can make inferences using the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning this model as a .tflite directly in the Nicla was impossible. So, we can sacrifice the accuracy using a smaller model or deploy the model as an OpenMV Firmware (FW). Choosing FW, the Edge Impulse Studio generates optimized models, libraries, and frameworks needed to make the inference. Let’s explore this option.\nSelect OpenMV Firmware on the Deploy Tab and press [Build].\n\n\n\n\n\nOn your computer, you will find a ZIP file. Open it:\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Bootloader tool on the OpenMV IDE to load the FW on your board:\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate file (.bin for Nicla-Vision):\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the download is finished, press OK:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a message says that the FW is outdated, DO NOT UPGRADE. Select [NO].\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, open the script ei_image_classification.py that was downloaded from the Studio and the.bin file for the Nicla.\n\n\n\n\n\nRun it. Pointing the camera to the objects we want to classify, the inference result will be displayed on the Serial Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10.2.1 Changing the Code to add labels\nThe code provided by Edge Impulse can be modified so that we can see, for test reasons, the inference result directly on the image displayed on the OpenMV IDE.\nUpload the code from GitHub, or modify it as below:\n# Marcelo Rovai - NICLA Vision - Image Classification\n# Adapted from Edge Impulse - OpenMV Image Classification Example\n# @24Aug23\n\nimport sensor, image, time, os, tf, uos, gc\n\nsensor.reset()                         # Reset and initialize the sensor.\nsensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)    # Set pxl fmt to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)\nsensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)      # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)\nsensor.set_windowing((240, 240))       # Set 240x240 window.\nsensor.skip_frames(time=2000)          # Let the camera adjust.\n\nnet = None\nlabels = None\n\ntry:\n    # Load built in model\n    labels, net = tf.load_builtin_model('trained')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise Exception(e)\n\nclock = time.clock()\nwhile(True):\n    clock.tick()  # Starts tracking elapsed time.\n\n    img = sensor.snapshot()\n\n    # default settings just do one detection\n    for obj in net.classify(img, \n                            min_scale=1.0, \n                            scale_mul=0.8, \n                            x_overlap=0.5, \n                            y_overlap=0.5):\n        fps = clock.fps()\n        lat = clock.avg()\n\n        print(\"**********\\nPrediction:\")\n        img.draw_rectangle(obj.rect())\n        # This combines the labels and confidence values into a list of tuples\n        predictions_list = list(zip(labels, obj.output()))\n\n        max_val = predictions_list[0][1]\n        max_lbl = 'background'\n        for i in range(len(predictions_list)):\n            val = predictions_list[i][1]\n            lbl = predictions_list[i][0]\n\n            if val &gt; max_val:\n                max_val = val\n                max_lbl = lbl\n\n    # Print label with the highest probability\n    if max_val &lt; 0.5:\n        max_lbl = 'uncertain'\n    print(\"{} with a prob of {:.2f}\".format(max_lbl, max_val))\n    print(\"FPS: {:.2f} fps ==&gt; latency: {:.0f} ms\".format(fps, lat))\n\n    # Draw label with highest probability to image viewer\n    img.draw_string(\n        10, 10,\n        max_lbl + \"\\n{:.2f}\".format(max_val),\n        mono_space = False,\n        scale=2\n        )\nHere you can see the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the latency (136 ms) is almost double of what we got directly with the Arduino IDE. This is because we are using the IDE as an interface and also the time to wait for the camera to be ready. If we start the clock just before the inference:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latency will drop to only 71 ms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NiclaV runs about half as fast when connected to the IDE. The FPS should increase once disconnected.\n\n\n\n2.10.2.2 Post-Processing with LEDs\nWhen working with embedded machine learning, we are looking for devices that can continually proceed with the inference and result, taking some action directly on the physical world and not displaying the result on a connected computer.

The model still only recognizes the predominant category on the image, the tabby cat:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what happens if there is not a dominant category on the image?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model identifies the above image completely wrong as an “ashcan,” possibly due to the color tonalities.\n\nThe model used in all previous examples is the MobileNet, trained with a large dataset, the ImageNet.\n\nTo solve this issue, we need another type of model, where not only multiple categories (or labels) can be found but also where the objects are located on a given image.\nAs we can imagine, such models are much more complicated and bigger, for example, the MobileNetV2 SSD FPN-Lite 320x320, trained with the COCO dataset. This pre-trained object detection model is designed to locate up to 10 objects within an image, outputting a bounding box for each object detected. The below image is the result of such a model running on a Raspberry Pi:\n\n\n\n\n\nThose models used for Object detection (such as the MobileNet SSD or YOLO) usually have several MB in size, which is OK for use with Raspberry Pi but unsuitable for use with embedded devices, where the RAM usually is lower than 1M Bytes.\n\n\n3.1.2 An innovative solution for Object Detection: FOMO\nEdge Impulse launched in 2022, FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects), a novel solution to perform object detection on embedded devices, not only on the Nicla Vision (Cortex M7) but also on Cortex M4F CPUs (Arduino Nano33 and OpenMV M4 series) as well the Espressif ESP32 devices (ESP-CAM and XIAO ESP32S3 Sense).\nIn this Hands-On exercise, we will explore using FOMO with Object Detection, not entering many details about the model itself. To understand more about how the model works, you can go into the official FOMO announcement by Edge Impulse, where Louis Moreau and Mat Kelcey explain in detail how it works."

The main reason this is possible is that while other models calculate the object’s size by drawing a square around it (bounding box), FOMO ignores the size of the image, providing only the information about where the object is located in the image, by means of its centroid coordinates.\nHow FOMO works?\nFOMO takes the image in grayscale and divides it into blocks of pixels using a factor of 8. For the input of 96x96, the grid would be 12x12 (96/8=12). Next, FOMO will run a classifier through each pixel block to calculate the probability that there is a box or a wheel in each of them and, subsequently, determine the regions which have the highest probability of containing the object (If a pixel block has no objects, it will be classified as background). From the overlap of the final region, the FOMO provides the coordinates (related to the image dimensions) of the centroid of this region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor training, we should select a pre-trained model. Let’s use the FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) MobileNetV2 0.35`. This model uses around 250KB RAM and 80KB of ROM (Flash), which suits well with our board since it has 1MB of RAM and ROM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the training hyper-parameters, the model will be trained with:\n\nEpochs: 60,\nBatch size: 32\nLearning Rate: 0.001.\n\nFor validation during training, 20% of the dataset (validation_dataset) will be spared. For the remaining 80% (train_dataset), we will apply Data Augmentation, which will randomly flip, change the size and brightness of the image, and crop them, artificially increasing the number of samples on the dataset for training.\nAs a result, the model ends with practically 1.00 in the F1 score, with a similar result when using the Test data.\n\nNote that FOMO automatically added a 3rd label background to the two previously defined (box and wheel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn object detection tasks, accuracy is generally not the primary evaluation metric. Object detection involves classifying objects and providing bounding boxes around them, making it a more complex problem than simple classification. The issue is that we do not have the bounding box, only the centroids. In short, using accuracy as a metric could be misleading and may not provide a complete understanding of how well the model is performing. Because of that, we will use the F1 score.\n\n\n3.6.1 Test model with “Live Classification”\nSince Edge Impulse officially supports the Nicla Vision, let’s connect it to the Studio. For that, follow the steps:\n\nDownload the last EI Firmware and unzip it.\nOpen the zip file on your computer and select the uploader related to your OS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the Nicla-Vision on Boot Mode, pressing the reset button twice.\nExecute the specific batch code for your OS for uploading the binary (arduino-nicla-vision.bin) to your board.\n\nGo to Live classification section at EI Studio, and using webUSB, connect your Nicla Vision:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce connected, you can use the Nicla to capture actual images to be tested by the trained model on Edge Impulse Studio.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to be noted is that the model can produce false positives and negatives. This can be minimized by defining a proper Confidence Threshold (use the Three dots menu for the set-up). Try with 0.8 or more."

    "section": "4.3 Introduction to Audio Signals",
    "text": "4.3 Introduction to Audio Signals\nUnderstanding the basic properties of audio signals is crucial for effective feature extraction and, ultimately, for successfully applying machine learning algorithms in audio classification tasks. Audio signals are complex waveforms that capture fluctuations in air pressure over time. These signals can be characterized by several fundamental attributes: sampling rate, frequency, and amplitude.\n\nFrequency and Amplitude: Frequency refers to the number of oscillations a waveform undergoes per unit time and is also measured in Hz. In the context of audio signals, different frequencies correspond to different pitches. Amplitude, on the other hand, measures the magnitude of the oscillations and correlates with the loudness of the sound. Both frequency and amplitude are essential features that capture audio signals’ tonal and rhythmic qualities.\nSampling Rate: The sampling rate, often denoted in Hertz (Hz), defines the number of samples taken per second when digitizing an analog signal. A higher sampling rate allows for a more accurate digital representation of the signal but also demands more computational resources for processing. Typical sampling rates include 44.1 kHz for CD-quality audio and 16 kHz or 8 kHz for speech recognition tasks. Understanding the trade-offs in selecting an appropriate sampling rate is essential for balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. In general, with TinyML projects, we work with 16KHz. Altough music tones can be heard at frequencies up to 20 kHz, voice maxes out at 8 kHz. Traditional telephone systems use an 8 kHz sampling frequency.\n\n\nFor an accurate representation of the signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.\n\n\nTime Domain vs. Frequency Domain: Audio signals can be analyzed in the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, a signal is represented as a waveform where the amplitude is plotted against time. This representation helps to observe temporal features like onset and duration but the signal’s tonal characteristics are not well evidenced. Conversely, a frequency domain representation provides a view of the signal’s constituent frequencies and their respective amplitudes, typically obtained via a Fourier Transform. This is invaluable for tasks that require understanding the signal’s spectral content, such as identifying musical notes or speech phonemes (our case).\n\nThe image below shows the words YES and NO with typical representations in the Time (Raw Audio) and Frequency domains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Why Not Raw Audio?\nWhile using raw audio data directly for machine learning tasks may seem tempting, this approach presents several challenges that make it less suitable for building robust and efficient models.\nUsing raw audio data for Keyword Spotting (KWS), for example, on TinyML devices poses challenges due to its high dimensionality (using a 16 kHz sampling rate), computational complexity for capturing temporal features, susceptibility to noise, and lack of semantically meaningful features, making feature extraction techniques like MFCCs a more practical choice for resource-constrained applications.\nHere are some additional details of the critical issues associated with using raw audio:\n\nHigh Dimensionality: Audio signals, especially those sampled at high rates, result in large amounts of data. For example, a 1-second audio clip sampled at 16 kHz will have 16,000 individual data points. High-dimensional data increases computational complexity, leading to longer training times and higher computational costs, making it impractical for resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, the wide dynamic range of audio signals requires a significant amount of bits per sample, while conveying little useful information.\nTemporal Dependencies: Raw audio signals have temporal structures that simple machine learning models may find hard to capture. While recurrent neural networks like LSTMs can model such dependencies, they are computationally intensive and tricky to train on tiny devices.\nNoise and Variability: Raw audio signals often contain background noise and other non-essential elements affecting model performance. Additionally, the same sound can have different characteristics based on various factors such as distance from the microphone, the orientation of the sound source, and acoustic properties of the environment, adding to the complexity of the data.\nLack of Semantic Meaning: Raw audio doesn’t inherently contain semantically meaningful features for classification tasks. Features like pitch, tempo, and spectral characteristics, which can be crucial for speech recognition, are not directly accessible from raw waveform data.\nSignal Redundancy: Audio signals often contain redundant information, with certain portions of the signal contributing little to no value to the task at hand. This redundancy can make learning inefficient and potentially lead to overfitting.\n\nFor these reasons, feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Mel-Frequency Energies (MFEs), and simple Spectograms are commonly used to transform raw audio data into a more manageable and informative format. These features capture the essential characteristics of the audio signal while reducing dimensionality and noise, facilitating more effective machine learning."

    "section": "4.4 Introduction to MFCCs",
    "text": "4.4 Introduction to MFCCs\n\n4.4.1 What are MFCCs?\nMel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a set of features derived from the spectral content of an audio signal. They are based on human auditory perceptions and are commonly used to capture the phonetic characteristics of an audio signal. The MFCCs are computed through a multi-step process that includes pre-emphasis, framing, windowing, applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the signal to the frequency domain, and finally, applying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The result is a compact representation of the original audio signal’s spectral characteristics.\nThe image below shows the words YES and NO in their MFCC representation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video explains the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and how to compute them.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Why are MFCCs important?\nMFCCs are crucial for several reasons, particularly in the context of Keyword Spotting (KWS) and TinyML:\n\nDimensionality Reduction: MFCCs capture essential spectral characteristics of the audio signal while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the data, making it ideal for resource-constrained TinyML applications.\nRobustness: MFCCs are less susceptible to noise and variations in pitch and amplitude, providing a more stable and robust feature set for audio classification tasks.\nHuman Auditory System Modeling: The Mel scale in MFCCs approximates the human ear’s response to different frequencies, making them practical for speech recognition where human-like perception is desired.\nComputational Efficiency: The process of calculating MFCCs is computationally efficient, making it well-suited for real-time applications on hardware with limited computational resources.\n\nIn summary, MFCCs offer a balance of information richness and computational efficiency, making them popular for audio classification tasks, particularly in constrained environments like TinyML.\n\n\n4.4.3 Computing MFCCs\nThe computation of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) involves several key steps. Let’s walk through these, which are particularly important for Keyword Spotting (KWS) tasks on TinyML devices.\n\nPre-emphasis: The first step is pre-emphasis, which is applied to accentuate the high-frequency components of the audio signal and balance the frequency spectrum. This is achieved by applying a filter that amplifies the difference between consecutive samples. The formula for pre-emphasis is: y(t) = x(t) - \\(\\alpha\\) x(t-1) , where \\(\\alpha\\) is the pre-emphasis factor, typically around 0.97.\nFraming: Audio signals are divided into short frames (the frame length), usually 20 to 40 milliseconds. This is based on the assumption that frequencies in a signal are stationary over a short period. Framing helps in analyzing the signal in such small time slots. The frame stride (or step) will displace one frame and the adjacent. Those steps could be sequential or overlapped.\nWindowing: Each frame is then windowed to minimize the discontinuities at the frame boundaries. A commonly used window function is the Hamming window. Windowing prepares the signal for a Fourier transform by minimizing the edge effects. The image below shows three frames (10, 20, and 30) and the time samples after windowing (note that the frame length and frame stride are 20 ms):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to each windowed frame to convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain. The FFT gives us a complex-valued representation that includes both magnitude and phase information. However, for MFCCs, only the magnitude is used to calculate the Power Spectrum. The power spectrum is the square of the magnitude spectrum and measures the energy present at each frequency component.\n\n\nThe power spectrum \\(P(f)\\) of a signal \\(x(t)\\) is defined as \\(P(f) = |X(f)|^2\\), where \\(X(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(x(t)\\). By squaring the magnitude of the Fourier Transform, we emphasize stronger frequencies over weaker ones, thereby capturing more relevant spectral characteristics of the audio signal. This is important in applications like audio classification, speech recognition, and Keyword Spotting (KWS), where the focus is on identifying distinct frequency patterns that characterize different classes of audio or phonemes in speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMel Filter Banks: The frequency domain is then mapped to the Mel scale, which approximates the human ear’s response to different frequencies. The idea is to extract more features (more filter banks) in the lower frequencies and less in the high frequencies. Thus, it performs well on sounds distinguished by the human ear. Typically, 20 to 40 triangular filters extract the Mel-frequency energies. These energies are then log-transformed to convert multiplicative factors into additive ones, making them more suitable for further processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT): The last step is to apply the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the log Mel energies. The DCT helps to decorrelate the energies, effectively compressing the data and retaining only the most discriminative features. Usually, the first 12-13 DCT coefficients are retained, forming the final MFCC feature vector."

This is often desirable for speech-related tasks. On the other hand, spectrograms or MFEs preserve more detailed frequency information, which can be advantageous in tasks that require discrimination based on fine-grained spectral content.\n\n4.6.1.1 MFCCs are particularly strong for:\n\nSpeech Recognition: MFCCs are excellent for identifying phonetic content in speech signals.\nSpeaker Identification: They can be used to distinguish between different speakers based on voice characteristics.\nEmotion Recognition: MFCCs can capture the nuanced variations in speech indicative of emotional states.\nKeyword Spotting: Especially in TinyML, where low computational complexity and small feature size are crucial.\n\n\n\n4.6.1.2 Spectrograms or MFEs are often more suitable for:\n\nMusic Analysis: Spectrograms can capture harmonic and timbral structures in music, which is essential for tasks like genre classification, instrument recognition, or music transcription.\nEnvironmental Sound Classification: In recognizing non-speech, environmental sounds (e.g., rain, wind, traffic), the full spectrogram can provide more discriminative features.\nBirdsong Identification: The intricate details of bird calls are often better captured using spectrograms.\nBioacoustic Signal Processing: In applications like dolphin or bat call analysis, the fine-grained frequency information in a spectrogram can be essential.\nAudio Quality Assurance: Spectrograms are often used in professional audio analysis to identify unwanted noises, clicks, or other artifacts."

    "text": "5.4 Dataset\nThe critical component of any Machine Learning Workflow is the dataset. Once we have decided on specific keywords (YES and NO), we can take advantage of the dataset developed by Pete Warden, “Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition.” This dataset has 35 keywords (with +1,000 samples each), such as yes, no, stop, and go. In some words, we can get 1,500 samples, such as yes and no.\nYou can download a small portion of the dataset from Edge Studio (Keyword spotting pre-built dataset), which includes samples from the four classes we will use in this project: yes, no, noise, and background. For this, follow the steps below:\n\nDownload the keywords dataset.\nUnzip the file in a location of your choice.\n\n\n5.4.1 Uploading the dataset to the Edge Impulse Studio\nInitiate a new project at Edge Impulse Studio.\n\nHere, you can clone the project developed for this hands-on: Nicla-Vision-KWS.\n\nSelect the Upload Existing Data tool in the Data Acquisition section. Choose the files to be uploaded:\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the Label, select Automatically split between train and test, and Upload data to the Studio. Repete to all classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset will now appear in the Data acquisition section. Note that the approximately 6,000 samples (1,500 for each class) are split between Train (4,800) and Test (1,200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Capturing additional Audio Data\nAlthough we have a lot of data from Pete’s dataset, collecting some words spoken by us is advised. When working with accelerometers, creating a dataset with data captured by the same type of sensor is essential. Still, In the case of sound, it is different because what we will classify is, in reality, audio data.\n\nThe key difference between sound and audio is their form of energy. Sound is mechanical wave energy (longitudinal sound waves) that propagate through a medium causing variations in pressure within the medium. Audio is made of electrical energy (analog or digital signals) that represent sound electrically.\n\nThe sound waves should be converted to audio data when we speak a keyword. The conversion should be done by sampling the signal generated by the microphone in 16KHz with a 16-bit depth.\nSo, any device that can generate audio data with this basic specification (16Khz/16bits) will work fine. As a device, we can use the proper NiclaV, a computer, or even your mobile phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1 Using the NiclaV and the Edge Impulse Studio\nAs we learned in the chapter Setup Nicla Vision, Edge Impulse officially supports the Nicla Vision, which simplifies the capture of the data from its sensors, such as the microphone. So, please create a new project on the Studio and connect the Nicla to it. For that, follow the steps:\n\nDownload the most updated EI Firmware and unzip it.\nOpen the zip file on your computer and select the uploader corresponding to your OS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the Nicla-Vision on Boot Mode, pressing the reset button twice.\n\n\n\nExecute the specific batch code for your OS for uploading the binary arduino-nicla-vision.bin to your board.\n\nGo to your project on the Studio, and on the Data Acquisition tab, select WebUSB. A window will pop up; choose the option that shows that the Nicla is paired and press [Connect].\nYou can choose which sensor data to pick in the Collect Data section on the Data Acquisition tab. Select: Built-in microphone, define your label (for example, yes), the sampling Frequency[16000Hz], and the Sample length (ms.), for example [10s]. Start sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll data on Pete’s dataset have a 1s length, but the samples recorded have 10s and must be split into 1s samples to be compatible. Click on three dots after the sample name and select Split sample.\nA window will pop up with the Split tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce inside the tool, split the data into 1-second (1000 ms) records. If necessary, add or remove segments. This procedure should be repeated for all new samples.\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Using a smartphone and the Studio\nAlternatively, you can use your PC or smartphone to capture audio data with a sampling frequency of 16KHz and a bit depth of 16 Bits.\nGo to Devices, and using your phone scan the QR Code, and click on the link. A data Collection app will appear in your browser. Select Collecting Audio, and define your Label, data capture Length, and Category.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the same procedure used with the NiclaV.\n\nNote that any app, such as Audacity, can be used for audio recording since you have 16KHz/16-bit depth samples."

    "text": "5.5 Creating Impulse (Pre-Process / Model definition)\nAn impulse takes raw data, uses signal processing to extract features, and then uses a learning block to classify new data.\n\n5.5.1 Impulse Design\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will take the data points with a 1-second window, augmenting the data, sliding that window each 500ms. Note that the option zero-pad data is set. It is essential to fill with zeros samples smaller than 1 second (in some cases, some samples can result smaller than the 1000 ms window on the split tool to avoid noises and spikes).\nEach 1-second audio sample should be pre-processed and converted to an image (for example, 13 x 49 x 1). As discussed in the Feature Engineering for Audio Classification, Hands-On tutorial, We will use Audio (MFCC), which extracts features from audio signals using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, which are applicable to the human voice that is our case here.\nNext, we select the Classification block to build our model from scratch using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Transfer Learning (Keyword Spotting) block, which fine-tunes a pre-trained keyword spotting model on your data. This approach has good performance with relatively small keyword datasets.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Pre-Processing (MFCC)\nThe next step is to create the features to be trained in the next phase:\nWe can keep the default parameter values or take advantage of the DSP Autotune parameters option, which we will do.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will take the Raw features (our 1-second, 16Khz sampled audio data) and use the MFCC processing block to calculate the Processed features. For every 16,000 raw features (16,000 x 1 second), we will get 637 processed features (13 x 49).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result shows that we will only spend a little memory to pre-process data (16KB), with a latency of 34ms, which is excellent. For example, on an Arduino Nano (Cortex-M4f @ 64MHz), this same pre-process will take around 480ms. The chosen parameters, such as the FFT length [512], will significantly impact the latency.\nNow, let’s Save parameters and move to the Generated features tab, where the actual features will be generated. Using UMAP, a dimension reduction technique, the Feature explorer shows how the features are distributed on a two-dimensional plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result seems OK, with a visual and clear separation from yes features (in red) and no features (in blue). The unknown features seem nearer to the no space than the yes. This suggests that the keyword no has more propensity to false positives.\n\n\n5.5.3 Going under the hood\nTo better understand how the raw sound is preprocessed, take a look at the Feature Engineering for Audio Classification chapter. You can play with the MFCC features generation in this notebook or [Open In Colab]"

The basic architecture has two blocks of Convolution + MaxPooling (8 and 16 filters, respectively) and a Dropout of 0.25 for the 1D and 0.5 for the 2D. For the last layer, after Flattening 4 neurons, one for each class:\n\n\n\nFor better visualization, open the image on another tab (use the right button)\n\n\nAs hyper-parameters, we will have a Learning Rate of [0.005] and a model trained by [100] epochs. We will also include a data augmentation method based on SpecAugment. We trained the 1D and the 2D models with the same hyperparameters. The 1D architecture had a better overall result (90.5% accuracy when compared with 88% of the 2D, so we will use the 1D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing 1D convolutions is more efficient because it requires fewer parameters than 2D convolutions, making them more suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n\nIt is also interesting to pay attention to the 1D Confusion Matrix. The F1 Score for yes is 95%, and for no, 91%. That was expected by what we saw with the Feature Explorer (no and unknown at near spaces). In trying to improve the result, you can closely examine the results by the samples with an error.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to listen to the samples that went wrong. For example, for yes, most of the wrongs were related to a yes pronunciation as “yeh”. You can get more samples like that and retrain your model.\n\n5.6.1 Going under the hood\nIf you want to understand what is happening “under the hood,” you can download the pre-processed dataset (MFCC training data) from the Dashboard tab and run this Jupyter Notebook, playing with the code [Open In Colab]. For example, you can analyze the accuracy by each epoch:"

We got 0.90, an excellent result once we expect to use this keyword to primarily “trigger” our KWS project. The worst result (0.70) is for UNKNOWN, what is OK.\nFor NO, we got 0.72, which was expected, but one action that can be done here is to take those samples that were not correctly classified, move them to the training dataset, and repeat the training process.\n\n5.7.1 Live Classification\nWe can proceed with the project but consider that it is possible to perform Live Classification using the NiclaV or a smartphone to capture live samples, testing the trained model before deployment on our device."

Let’s do it now with the nicla-vision_microphone_continuous.\nStart with initializing the LEDs:\n...\nvoid setup()\n{\n        // Once you finish debugging your code, you can comment or delete the Serial part of the code\n    Serial.begin(115200);\n    while (!Serial);\n    Serial.println(\"Inferencing - Nicla Vision KWS with LEDs\");\n    \n    // Pins for the built-in RGB LEDs on the Arduino NiclaV\n    pinMode(LEDR, OUTPUT);\n    pinMode(LEDG, OUTPUT);\n    pinMode(LEDB, OUTPUT);\n\n    // Ensure the LEDs are OFF by default.\n    // Note: The RGB LEDs on the Arduino Nicla Vision\n    // are ON when the pin is LOW, OFF when HIGH.\n    digitalWrite(LEDR, HIGH);\n    digitalWrite(LEDG, HIGH);\n    digitalWrite(LEDB, HIGH);\n...\n}\nCreate two functions, turn_off_leds() function , to turn off all RGB LEDs\n**\n * @brief      turn_off_leds function - turn-off all RGB LEDs\n */\nvoid turn_off_leds(){\n    digitalWrite(LEDR, HIGH);\n    digitalWrite(LEDG, HIGH);\n    digitalWrite(LEDB, HIGH);\n}\nand another turn_on_led() function, which is used to turn on the RGB LEDs depending on the index of the most probable result of the classifier.\n/**\n * @brief      turn_on_leds function used to turn on the RGB LEDs\n * @param[in]  pred_index     \n *             no:       [0] ==&gt; Red ON\n *             noise:    [1] ==&gt; ALL OFF \n *             unknown:  [2] ==&gt; Blue ON\n *             Yes:      [3] ==&gt; Green ON\n */\nvoid turn_on_leds(int pred_index) {\n  switch (pred_index)\n  {\n    case 0:\n      turn_off_leds();\n      digitalWrite(LEDR, LOW);\n      break;\n\n    case 1:\n      turn_off_leds();\n      break;\n    \n    case 2:\n      turn_off_leds();\n      digitalWrite(LEDB, LOW);\n      break;\n\n    case 3:\n      turn_off_leds();\n      digitalWrite(LEDG, LOW);\n      break;\n  }\n}\nAnd change the // print the predictions portion of the code on loop():\n...\n\n    if (++print_results &gt;= (EI_CLASSIFIER_SLICES_PER_MODEL_WINDOW)) {\n        // print the predictions\n        ei_printf(\"Predictions \");\n        ei_printf(\"(DSP: %d ms., Classification: %d ms., Anomaly: %d ms.)\",\n            result.timing.dsp, result.timing.classification, result.timing.anomaly);\n        ei_printf(\": \\n\");\n\n        int pred_index = 0;     // Initialize pred_index\n        float pred_value = 0;   // Initialize pred_value\n\n        for (size_t ix = 0; ix &lt; EI_CLASSIFIER_LABEL_COUNT; ix++) {\n            if (result.classification[ix].value &gt; pred_value){\n                pred_index = ix;\n                pred_value = result.classification[ix].value;\n            }\n            // ei_printf(\"    %s: \", result.classification[ix].label);\n            // ei_printf_float(result.classification[ix].value);\n            // ei_printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n        ei_printf(\"  PREDICTION: ==&gt; %s with probability %.2f\\n\", \n                  result.classification[pred_index].label, pred_value);\n        turn_on_leds (pred_index);\n\n        \n#if EI_CLASSIFIER_HAS_ANOMALY == 1\n        ei_printf(\"    anomaly score: \");\n        ei_printf_float(result.anomaly);\n        ei_printf(\"\\n\");\n#endif\n\n        print_results = 0;\n    }\n}\n\n...\nYou can find the complete code on the project’s GitHub.\nUpload the sketch to your board and test some real inferences. The idea is that the RGB Green LED will be ON whenever the keyword YES is detected, the same for NO (Red) and any other word that turns on the Blue LED. If silence or background noise is present, the LEDs should be off. In the same way, instead of turning on an LED, this could be a “trigger” for an external device, as we saw in the introduction."
